       " Before folks get to trashing this review let me tell you why I rated this game the way I did. For starters, this lacks several things found in GTASA, the last game in the GTA series. It was so good it spawned the 360 knockoff Saints Row, which isn't bad by the way. They left out the things that made that game great such as dual weapon weilding, building experience in driving, swimming etc., ability to learn new fighting styles, customizing the character with tatts, haircuts, and being able to change the body type by working out or eating excessively. They also left out customizing your cars! Followed by the lack of clothing, and seriously, they have like two good outfits, the rest are completely retarded. Its damn near impossible to make Niko look cool. But thats only the beginning of the things that piss me off in this game. The major thing is that there is NOTHING to spend your money on!!! I mean really, whats the point of doing missions for money if you can't buy anything?? They don't have houses for sale like in all the previous GTA's, they don't have exotic car dealerships, or anything to spend cash on. So I'm sitting here playing a game with tons of cash that has virtually nothing spend it on! The worst part is they taunt you by having the stores in the game, but you can't go in! You gotta be kidding me. Thats a major flaw in this game. To top it off, 360 got exclusive rights to downloadable content, meaning us ps3 owners only get what we got while 360 owners get extras. Thats some BS! This game barely has any side missions, and thus barely any replay value. I say gamefly this, and don't blow 60 bucks on a pretty game. In essence thats all they did was make a game with great graphics, and less content. The same way they did madden 07. The other major gripe I have is because all the crap Rockstar told us about being able to go into almost all the buildings. What a heap of crap that was, you can only go into assigned clothing stores, gun stores and activities/resturants. Everything else? Forget it! They have these great looking stores with massive signs and flashy lights that serve no purpose at all. Why did they even put tattoo shops in the game if you can't go in to get a tatt? If this wasn't a GTA game I would give it more stars, but I've come to expect more out of Rockstar, and this game totally let me down. The storyline is ok, it follows the same pattern of every GTA game, \"guy with troubled past has to make his way up through the mean streets to gain money\" which I have no problem with, it just doesnt do anything to make me want to play it through all the flaws. Don't believe all the hype, i hate it when people give games great ratings when they are so blatantly ripping us off by giving us half a$$ games. It does nothing but tell the developers that we are easily sold on a name and pretty graphics. Demand more from your games and when you don't get it, let the developers know! I payed 60 bucks for this, and it doesn't have as much content as the PS2 version of the prequal?? Hell naw! I'm pissed.\" - 593 Tokens,\n",

When you drop a nuclear bomb, anything, or anyone for that matter, is destroyed within the explosion radius. You have to worry about radiation, too. After you drop your fist Nuke, a little sign comes up and says: Armaggedon-15. After you drop another Nuke, the number drops to 14.

       " \n",
       " Okay things about the Witcher 2:\n",
       " \n",
       " 1. Combat is good and bad. I like the sword and magic combo fighting style, but don't like that they have designed it to be done with a gamepad. Specifically the Xbox 360 gamepad, which I don't have yet! I prefer using a keyboard and mouse. By the way, the game requirements state that it requires an Xbox 360 gamepad. I have read others complain that some brands of gamepads will work with this game but many wont. For example my old Saitek gamepad doesn't work with this game.\n",
       " \n",
       " 2. Character development by leveling up is okay, but it was better in the original Witcher. My favorite part of an RPG is developing my character's skills and attributes to build a powerful character. They dummied down the leveling up process for people who don't like to think and plan ahead that much in games.\n",
       " \n",
       " 3. Difficulty it better than the first Witcher which I found to be as bit to easy even on the hard level. It is now a bit unbalanced, some battles are too easy and others too difficult. I find myself switching back and forth between difficulty levels.\n",

       " Poor things about the Witcher 2:\n",

       " \n",
       " 2. Controls using the keyboard and mouse are clumsy. I changed all the keyboard keys in the game options and that helped some, but the game wouldn't let me assign control keys to the number pad, which I prefer for this style of combat. Edit - Gamepad controls work well.\n",
       " \n",
       " 3. There is no real option during combat for you to pause the game and plan out the battle. You can use the pause/break key to pause the game but you can't take any action while the game is paused in the manner. I liked it during The Witcher 1 you could pause the game and look up the monster you were fighting and decide how to fight it and change the sword and spell to fight it effectively.\n",
       " \n",
       " 4. I don't like the boxing, too much key press and timing skills required with no thought required at all. You could avoid it in the first Witcher, but they force you to box in Witcher 2. EDIT - boxing is much easier with a gamepad.\n",
       " \n",

It may seem like a long game to some of the less perceptive gamers, but in reality a lot of the game is simply doing the same exact things over and over again. I realize there may be some people out there that enjoy this type of mindless repetition, but for those who require a little more intellectual stimulation than your average assembly line worker, you will quickly begin to wonder what unimaginative knucklehead decided to make this part of the game. What makes this worse is the sometimes atrocious timing of these checkpoints. You will be amazed at how far back you can be set if you die before the designers allow you a save.

So naturally I was very excited when I heard that a sequel was on the way. Now that I've played through it a couple of times (once each for the light side and the dark side), here are my thoughts:\n",
       " \n",
       " The first thing that struck me about the game was how similar it is to its predecessor. The gameplay has been tweaked here and there with a few new variables thrown into the mix, but for the most part it plays just like the first game. The graphics may have been slightly improved in a couple of areas, but for the most part the look of this game is indistinguishable from that of the first. This is fine, though. I was hoping to see some better visuals this time around, but the graphics suffice, and the gameplay was solid to begin with, so why make any drastic changes?\n",
       " \n",
       " One area in which this game falls short, however, is in the story. I do like the characters, the dialogue is well written, and there are certainly some interesting events to be discovered, but the overarching story was often vague and uninteresting. I sometimes found myself getting impatient in long exposition scenes because I couldn't bring myself to care overly much about what was happening. That never occurred in the first KOTOR. The ending of the game was especially disappointing in this regard. I kept waiting for the point to come where the plot would reach a level commensurate with the level of tension and anticipation that the developers were obviously trying to create, but it never came. The last couple hours of the game were sadly anticlimactic.\n",
       " \n",
       " My other complaint is in regards to the game's difficulty, or more appropriately, its lack thereof. Even if you turn the difficulty setting to High, a decent player will find that there's not one point in the game that presents any real challenge. Your main character will have no trouble annihilating everything that crosses his path. The first KOTOR was too easy as well, in my opinion, but the problem is more pronounced in the sequel.\n",
       " \n",
       " Don't get me wrong; it's still fun, and I certainly recommend it. After the brilliant Knights of the Old Republic was released to such wide acclaim, the expectations placed upon this game were very high, and the fact that it fell short doesn't mean it's not worth your time. It's a good game. It just could have been better than it is.\" - 431 Tokens,\n",
       " Sentence: \"We purchase this for the kids room so they can always have charged controllers. If all of the controllers manage to lose power all at once, at least we can charge them all at once as well.\" - 37 Tokens,\n",
       " Sentence: \"This is an amazing game. It's incredibly addictive. The game combines some RPG type of elements with a stealth first person shooter, and the results are amazing. Vin Diesel was deeply involved in the game, and the results are incredible. The graphics are the best I've seen yet, and the action (from fist fights to using shivs) are awesome.\n",
       " If you're a fan of Pitch Black, get this game. It is worth it.\" - 72 Tokens,\n",
       " Sentence: \"First I'm going to get one thing out of the way before I write my review. I am a big fan of TNA as well as WWE. In fact, I like WWE a little better. I was very skeptical about buying this game. So I approached this game with an open mind.\n",
       " \n",
       " First off, these are the best graphics I've ever seen in a wrestling game. Simply amazing! Each wrestler is made to the very last detail. You can even see the beads of sweat fly off while wrestling.\n",
       " \n",
       " The actual wrestling is what really makes this game great. It doesn't feel robotic at all. The action is very smooth. The controls are pretty advanced, but after an hour, you should have them mastered. One of the slogans for this game was action so real, you'll feel pain. Well, I don't know about that, but it's probably as realistic as a wrestling game is gonna get with bone crushing action.\n",
       " \n",
       " I've heard a lot of complaints about how there aren't very many moves and that the game is not very deep. Unless you are a complete fanatic of wrestling (and I mean as hardcore as it gets), then you will be more than satisfied with the moves in the game. I think there is just as many moves if not more than the Smackdown vs Raw series.\n",
       " \n",
       " The one thing the game is a little lacking is match types. They have your standard single and tag matches, along with falls count anywhere. The real gem is Ultimate X. I just hope for the next TNA game there will be more choices like six sides of steel, king of the mountain, full metal mayhem, etc. Still, this is the only negative in the game, and it is a very minor one.\n",
       " \n",
       " Story mode is the best I've seen on the next gen platforms. You play as Suicide, which really becomes your created wrestler. Going from the bottom of the food chain back to TNA is very cool. Great story!\n",

       " Even though the roster has only 25 wrestlers, TNA Impact is going to be the first wrestling game to have DLC wrestlers. The first two announced are Petey Williams and Curry Man. More are to follow.\n",
       " \n",
       " I was skeptical to buy this game with all the negative reviews out there, but now I'm glad I bought it. This game will also push the Smackdown vs Raw series to be even better. In the end, we all win. My advice is to pick up this game. You'll be very glad that you did.\n",

       " Sentence: \"Last year, I received the original DJ Hero turntable for Christmas, and the game hooked me instantly. After only a couple weeks, I was already clamoring for a sequel. Thankfully, it came this year, and it's just as good...but it didn't quite meet my expectations.\n",
       " \n",
       " The additions they've made in this game, including the new/improved Empire (career) mode are welcome. The mixes are all top-notch, including everything from hip-hop to trance, dance, rock, disco, new wave, etc. There's plenty here for everyone, and it's the perfect party game, particularly now that you can have someone join in on the mic and another turntable. I opted to buy the turntable bundle, particularly because it was actually cheaper than the standalone game. I'd suggest that buyers try and find this turntable bundle discounted, even if they weren't considering another turntable, because it seems to be quite cheap at a lot of retailers.\n",
       " \n",
       " Because of the excellent mixes, I'd go as far to say that this is the #1 music game for parties, even if there's only one person playing. The music will get everyone feeling good. However, one disappointment is that this game does not include the DJ/guitar mode that the first DJ Hero had. Although there's not a great selection of mixes that would include guitar parts, it was still a fun addition and a good way to get people in who are not familiar with the turntable yet. Instead of a guitar, another player can join in on the mic...which is okay, but the mixes are not always conducive to being sung. It's a decent way to get someone else to join in, but the guitar mode was better. With two turntables and a mic, the game supports up to 3 players, but I can't help but wish they would have kept the DJ/guitar mode so that it could have had 4-player support.\n",
       " \n",
       " The turntable hardware you get here is identical to the one included with the original DJ Hero. Just as with the Guitar Hero instruments, the Wiimote is plugged into it to make it wireless. I like this because it alleviates the need for any extra batteries or a USB dongle. I've had no problems with my old turntable, and I don't foresee having any with this one. It's fairly sturdy and it feels good to play.\n",
       " \n",
       " While the title supports DLC, it's quite expensive (300 points per mix), and I'm disappointed to find that you cannot save DLC to the SD card, only to the Wii's internal memory. This was the case with the original DJ Hero, but I was hoping they'd do something about it for the sequel. This means you can only have a small catalog of DLC. Rock Band and Guitar Hero have supported saving DLC to an SD card for the past two years; why DJ Hero still isn't doing this is beyond me, because it means I'll be spending a lot less money on DLC now. Also disappointing is that you cannot import any songs from the original DJ Hero (though this goes for all versions, not just the Wii version). I guess it's not surprising though, as I imagine it would cost a lot to re-license all those tracks in addition to getting the licenses for the new ones.\n",
       " \n",
       " So, although DJ Hero 2 is a worthy sequel, it's no replacement. You will want to hold on to the original DJ Hero to keep those mixes (including all the Daft Punk, which I would sorely miss), and if you ever want to play DJ/guitar mode. If you just got a second turntable with this bundle, you can also go back and play those mixes with a second DJ. If you're totally new to DJ Hero, you'd do yourself well to buy both games in the turntable bundles...you could very well do it for under a hundred bucks.\" - 641 Tokens,\n",

The Dual Shock 4's touch-pad is usable on PS TV, and can be a stand-in for either the front or rear touch sensors on the Vita, plus most games never really needed or made full use of both touch sensors on the Vita, so it should be easily doable. As it is, even some major first-party titles like Wipeout 2048 are not compatible--lame!\n",

       " * Dual Shock 4's headset slot doesn't work with PS-TV--you'll need a bluetooth headset/headphones.\n",
       " * the on-board 1 GB flash RAM is not accessible if you insert a Vita memory card, which you will end up needing quickly for downloaded games. Vita memory cards are artificially low in capacity and high in price--very lame.\n",

This is about exploration of an unbelievable space station. It's a marvel of video games, and Arkane studios has delivered a modern masterpiece. If you like the 2 dishonored games, and your are a fan of their, you should definitely be at home on the Talos 1 space station. The alien enemy designs can be a little underwhelming, and the human graphics are amazing, very reminiscent of the art style of dishonored. I just wish you spent more time fighting humans. The way you explore the space station is very free flowing. There is a place you start, and there is a end game area, but there are definitely different ways to get there. I spent around 75 hours exploring Talos 1, and I beat the game only once. I was very thorough in doing the things I wanted to do.

       " This game features your Arcade mode, a track creator, Gran Turismo T.V., and a Career mode. I haven't tried the T.V. mode (and can't right now because PSN is down), but the Career mode is where the bulk of the gaming is. The Arcade lets you try out some cars...keyword: SOME, and you go through the Career to unlock the rest. Some cars are fairly cheap and still perform well, i.e. the Corvette ZR1 I have with race mods. Race mods are modifications to the car that turn it into a race car. The interior, exterior, and some performance parts are upgraded to racing specs. Thing is, only 11 cars can be modified to race specs. That doesn't mean those 11 are dominant cars, however. The EVO IX (or VIII...don't remember) wouldn't beat my GT-R SpecV, considering both are fully modded and tuned properly. The only cars that are completely dominant over the others are (as they should be) race-built cars, like the Formula One car Ferrari uses or the LMP1 Audi R10 TDI, which was Audi's old LeMans car before the R15 was introduced.\n",
       " \n",
       " In this mode, you have plenty to do. You can participate in License challenges which get harder as you progress, you can try your luck in A-Spec races, or teach a driver to perform well in B-Spec races. A-Spec puts you behind the wheel in the races while B-Spec puts an A.I. driver behind the wheel. Eventually you begin to unlock special events that you can complete to level yourself up. The game splits the leveling system into A-Spec and B-Spec levels. A-Spec leveling is affected by License, A-Spec, and Special Event challenges, while B-Spec can only go up through B-Spec races.\n",

       " As everyone already knows, Gran Turismo has always been a simulation game, and was first released on the PlayStation. However, my first simulation racing game was Forza Motorsports on the original Xbox, which led me to the sequel on the 360. Since I no longer have a 360, I decided to check out GT5: Prologue, which, obviously, was the preview to this game. I liked it, and picked this up.\n",
       " \n",
       " I have to say, I haven't been playing anything else but this game. It's that amazing.....the gameplay, I mean.\n",
       " \n",
       " Let's start with the good things first.\n",
       " \n",
       " One thing I LOVE about the game is the realism. Even though I only played the Forza 3 demo, it failed to hold my attention the way Gran Turismo 5: Prologue did, and helps to the fact that I can hardly put this game down. It seriously feels like you're in the car, feeling every twist, turn, bump, jump, braking, oversteer, and understeer the car dishes out at you. If you're losing traction in the rear tires, you're going to feel it through the vibration and how your car handles while you're trying to control it through a corner. You can also feel whenever your car is going over a bumpy surface, and the sense of speed is simply amazing. I have yet to play a game where it actually scared me to go too fast because it's like the object is very far away, and suddenly it goes \"SURPRISE! I'm right here! :D\", which makes you drive more carefully when trying to generate a hot lap.\n",
       " \n",
       " Another thing that's wonderful is the cars. While I still missed the Tuned Corvette from Prologue (hardly now thanks to the ZR1), I love driving in a GT-R SpecV, or the Zonda R around Laguna Seca, just to see if I can beat my old times. Though this game features a total of 1,034 cars, only 220 of them are premium, meaning that only 220 cars in the game have damage and in-car views.......among other things, but I can't remember them right now, and they're really not that important, anyway. One I DO remember is standards only have one light setting (I think) while premium cars have two.....wow, how cool, right? Something I'll never see on my car unless I'm watching a replay or I'm ALWAYS looking behind me.\n",
       " \n",
       " There really isn't much I can say that would make anyone think differently about Gran Turismo, but is also good. It's almost impossible to not understand how realistic this game really is, from the tuning options (though no upgrading brakes.....weird) to being placed into the driver seat of (some of) the cars, you should already know what it has to offer by now. None of that has changed. But if you're new to the series, be warned that it is heavily aimed at enthusiasts and people who love cars. Everyone else is just going to see a big mess and won't understand it.\n",
       " \n",
       " Now for the bad...\n",
       " \n",
       " The menu, while it looks nice in some parts, can get a bit confusing when you're trying to look for something in the Career mode. It's not a huge issue,especially for me, since I can figure out almost anything pretty quickly, but it's not exactly the most user-friendly menu, either. Another thing I don't like are the standard cars. They spent around 6 years on this game, but only 220 cars are \"premium\"? There shouldn't even be a difference between them if you're going to spend 6 years on a game. Then again, Sony did want to heavily push the PS3's 3D capabilities, which isn't Polyphony Digital's fault, but it wasn't a good idea to have 220 cars be \"better\" than the others. Again, not a huge deal, but noticeable. I also don't understand why my B-Spec driver is sometimes incredibly stupid, even in situations where I would be able to come out in first place. Sometimes he won't shift properly, and other times he'll spin for no reason. They are programmed to make mistakes if they become too excited or too relaxed, but for being level 20, it seems as if some of these shouldn't happen. Maybe I'm not 100% understanding the system as of now.....but again, can't see why they would make foolish mistakes.\n",
       " \n",
       " Another thing I didn't like (and this is actually my fault) is I bought a car that I ended up winning a few races later. It's pretty sad to buy a 2.6million credit (credit is the currency used in this game) Zonda R, only to win it a half-hour after you bought it.\n",
       " \n",
       " Overall, I love Gran Turismo 5 for its gameplay, but some of the mistakes in the game shouldn't be there, considering it took them 6 years to develop it. Nevertheless, this is a game I'll be playing for a while, and won't leave my library any time soon.\" - 1125 Tokens,\n",

       " The game itself is sometimes fun but usually isn't, especially in the competitive mode where fun dies. Winning is dependent on the competency of your team and since 9 out of 10 times you're gonna get a bad team incapable of prioritizing targets, you're gonna be loosing...a lot. Also I find that on many occasions, my opponent dishes out far more damage than I do even though our attacks are similar.

       " Leveling up can be an incredible chore and disappointment. You get a loot box per level with 4 random items like skins, emotes and sprays.

       " You play the game as Max Payne, an undercover DEA agent who's having a streak of a bad luck (to put it lightly). I don't want to ruin the story, but bottom line is that you'll end up having to shoot your way out of every situation. The gameplay is superb! With a short and painless tutorial, easy to navigate controls, and 10-20 minute learning curve, the game is quite easy to jump into and play. The story plays out like a bad action flick, but it's fitting and actually adds to the gameplay.\n",

Within the game you'll see bullet holes from every shot you've taken and looking down at the floor you'll even be able to count the shells from your gun. There is no item decay which helps add to the realism, if you gun down some punk you can run around for 20 minutes and when you return his body will still be there (and so will the shells from your gun). The story settings are excellent as well. Running around seedy parts of the Bronx while gunning down mobsters and drug addicts is quite a change of pace from the your normal shooter where you're on a space station killing stupid looking aliens. Also, the \"Bullet Time\" effect is something completely new to the genre that really makes the game shine. Basically what \"Bullet Time\" does is put the game in slow-motion allowing you to get a better edge in gun battles and perform beautiful action-movie-like stunts. Although \"Bullet Time\" sounds like a cheat, it's really what makes the game great. You won't be able to just do it whenver you want for as long as you want. You have an Hourglass that determines how much B-Time you have left, and even when it's full it's only a couple of seconds in total. Earning more B-Time requires you to kill thugs WITHOUT using the B-Time, so it is best saved for tight situations.\n",
       " Now although I do rate the game with 5 Stars, it does have it's annoyances. For one, the game is quite short. If you have a whole day to yourself you can blow through the game within a good 10 hours. Another annoying thing is the AI reflexes. It's almost impossible to sneak up on these thugs! The second you enter the room they are all aware of your presence, sometimes even before you enter. It's frustrating because these are supposed to be low-level hoodlums and yet they have the reflexes of a Navy SEAL. Another thing that will annoy the hell out of you is how long it can take to kill the people sometimes. You'd think a point-blank blast to the stomach from a Pump-Action Shotgun would be enough to finish off ANY human being... but be prepared to fire again. It'll also annoy you when you put 10 rounds from your Beretta into a gangsters chest to have him keep charging at you as if unaffected. Basically the bad-guys show no sign of pain or injury other than death. You can shoot him in the legs all you like, it won't do much other than kill him... eventually. But even with these problems I still rate the game a five because once you're playing, you won't even be thinking about these things. The game is short, but so much fun!\n",

Picking up a good-sized book is all well and good, but taking some of them (often slightly oversized from what I've seen) everywhere is a little overwhelming at times. So, in addition to the book I purchased (Japanese the Manga Way, which I strongly suggest if you're serious about learning the language) I picked this up to take with me wherever I go so I can practice on my breaks at work, while I'm eating lunch, etc.\n",
       " \n",
       " So let's start with the basics.\n",
       " \n",
       " Starting up is a snap. It's self-explanatory and is one of the easiest things of the entire game. However, regarding file management, I found it difficult to figure out how to delete files. This was mostly due in part to how far ahead the placement test put me. The instruction manual doesn't tell you how to do this and it's not from the main menu, but rather in the options section of the menu once you actually get into your file.\n",
       " \n",
       " Speaking of the placement test, that's the next thing. If you know a little Japanese, that's all well and good, and even better if you feel that you just want to move on. But I personally feel it should give you the option for a placement test or not, because not only in the earlier lessons did I come to find that there were certain words I didn't know, I wanted to be able to practice writing them and speaking them. (on that note, the speaking and comparison feature is absolutely wonderful. Possibly one of the best features of the game, granted you have enough peace and quiet to do so)\n",
       " \n",
       " The lessons themselves are rather short, but even when you would take a foreign language class in high school, the reality is you would only cover a maximum of about 3 pages in a single day out of your textbook on average. That said, I recommend taking your time and don't rush yourself. You'll just find yourself ending up worse and possibly confused later on. Their point is well explained, however, and the games only help pound the terms into your head (for the most part and depending on the game played).\n",
       " \n",
       " Only being on lesson 8-9 so far, I don't have even half of the games unlocked, so I really can't comment on any of the later ones. However, just to mention the initial three, there's a word search, a whack-a-mole equivalent, and a multiple choice test. The word search is generally useless, listing the English word at the top and you have to search for the Japanese term in it's place. This might be effective, but you instead focus so intently on the words your looking for, chances are the intention of focusing on their meaning gets lost. The whack-a-mole game on easy and medium difficulties is pretty useless, but once you try hard, it's almost like playing fast-paced multiple choice. Watch what you're hitting! And the multiple choice test is just that, possibly the best of the first three games.\n",
       " \n",
       " The next two unlocked are as useful both as the multiple choice, if not moreso. Fading characters is the absolute most effective way to really practice learning how to write Japanese at a fast speed, though beginners should start with the in-lesson training. While it may be true that some of the brush stroke sequences are supposedly off (so far I've yet to really notice anything) if you're going to learn the language and use it in the future, either you'll figure it out on your own through a different source or possibly through a native speaker. Being, from what I've read elsewhere, only about 30 or so stroke sequences are off, which isn't a big number at all and is, in my opinion, not something to really worry about. The next game after that tests your memory of how to write words, a true test to how well you've learned and been paying attention. Hard, but possibly one of the most useful tools on the cartridge in getting you extremely familiar with the language.\n",
       " \n",
       " The best thing about all the games is you can set them to Open mode, which uses only words you haven't mastered yet, unless you've, say, only got 3 words left to master, in which case the other 7 words will be replaced with mastered words from any lesson; or you can set it to mastered, which will only give you words you mastered. Again, a great way to effectively test yourself in the later lessons.\n",
       " \n",
       " The dictionary is wonderfully helpful as well, but I'd personally prefer a book-version dictionary instead. It would probably be more helpful, beneficiary and you can actually compare and contrast with this game to see where it got romaji spelling wrong or where it got kana/kanji wrong.\n",
       " \n",
       " All in all, the game is a wonderful tool for learning, but it's just that. The unfortunate thing is that it really doesn't do too much to make it really all that interesting and fun, which is sad because it's a great tool for learning. It becomes boring after a short while, and I never find myself completing more than one lesson at a time.\n",

The one thing I didn't like was when you used something, it didn't look like you were physically using it. For instance, when using a key to unlock a door, it just shows the key floating to the lock, going in the lock, and turning. That was unrealistic, and it's my only complaint in the graphics department.\n",

       " Sound-There is no music in this game except once at the beginning, every now and then you hear some from the bar, and when you are near a radio you can turn it to a music station. The sound effects are pretty creepy. In some rooms, you would hear this whisper that you couldn't understand, and in some rooms you would hear a very clear voice talking to you, but nobody is there! My one complaint in the sound department would be that sometimes when you open a drawer, pick up something, etc. it would echo the sound.

Sometimes, something will move or flicker, but most of the time the picture is still. You cursor is a plus sign, and it turns to an arrow to move, magnifying glass to examine, wrench to fiddle or fix, and I think a hand to pick up. You don't pick many things up. I think at the end of the game, I found that I had only collected 8 items. You do have to write notes in this game, but it isn't that bad. It's just every now and then, but you do have to read a lot of things in this story. That's where you find out what happened, because you are unable to talk to anyone (who's alive at least) in the game. The puzzles in this game were perfect, I thought. They were easy enough to understand, but they were hard enough that you had to really think about them. I never had to use a walkthrough. There is even an in-game hint system which you can use at anytime (well, almost anytime). I just want to give a warning to potential players, this game is very supernatural. There is a ouija board that you can use (although you do not have to in order to accomplish anything), and the game revolves a bit around alchemy.

If you cling to your notes, you can probably finish the game within 30 minutes of starting a new game, but if you don't look at your old notes, and start some new ones, you might have another fun go at it.

AC III has ended that drought, and as high as my expectations were, they have been exceeded. This is a startlingly ambitious advancement for this series, and finally, a true sequel in which the developers don't simply recycle the exact same coding (graphics, animation, physics) as the previous title with the addition of only a follow-up story and new locales. The latter were the two games that followed Assassin's Creed 2. Though they were very good, I think they should've been exclusively downloadable for about $30-$35 in my opinion.

Game play wise, there is a lot to like, though what you may find may not be as revolutionary as you think. Being able to rent/buy items from the very beginning as a opposed to finding them in sequence (i.e. traditional Zelda) is a nice idea, but maybe not exactly a \"game changer\" . It does allow you to tackle dungeons in any sequence you want, but I found this hardly made a difference in my enjoyment in the game. It's still not exactly an \"open world\", and the objective is still the same: get through all the dungeons. And you still need certain items to do the dungeon which they basically hint to you at the entrance. And once you figure that out, all you need to do is go back and rent/buy that item(s) if you haven't already. Which brings up another point. The whole renting system is meant to make you think twice about what you take because it costs money, and if you die, you lose your items. But I never found this to be an issue for me since I can easily just reload my save file when I die. And getting money in this game is really never a problem. So basically, get the item(s), do the dungeon. Being able to merge into walls is a really cool idea and adds a whole new game play mechanic to the game. However, this idea really ends up controlling the overall design of the game. Like the dungeons are very creative and you do use this ability a lot in them, but I really felt like everything was laid out for you. You knew what to do, and getting through dungeons was a breeze for the most part. But there are definitely some moments where you will see some very clever use for this new ability. Story wise, it's pretty much a straight forward ordeal. Hyrule is in trouble, save Princess Zelda! With some twists and turns of course. I never really felt to engrossed in the game's story because it felt like a side story in the overall Zelda story arc. But anyway.

It is definitely a puzzle game.\n",

The first being that many missions are fairly short, meaning that this game only really serves as an expansion of Metal Gear Solid. It's a mystery why Konami didn't just start packing it in with the original game after a while. It never really happened. The second huge problem is that the game advertises that it has 300 missions. What they don't mention is that many of those missions are the same. You'll undergo one mission and then be expected to do it again in a Time Attack. To the developers this serves as two different missions, but it's the same mission. The only difference is that you'll be doing it with an additional challenge.\n",

You can also connect them to your cell phone, iPod, iPad, Windows Pro and any other tablet you can think of. As a bonus (although considering it gets released next week so maybe not a bonus as per se) you will be able to use these headphones with the new playstation 4 as long as you download the day 1 1.50 patch. I can't however find any information regarding their use with the new Xbox One but would be surprised if they weren't also compatible with that given the range of connection options it comes with.

       " The headphones are fully adjustable in every way that you could want. The ear pieces rotate, the headband is expandable and snaps into place at various stops so as not to slide. It actually reminds me a bit of zip ties in the way it does it. The leather(ish) (it's not actual leather but looks and feels like soft leather) headband is well padded, soft and won't hurt your head, as are the ear pieces. It fits very comfortably and snugly and I've worn them playing GTA V for a couple of hours with no soreness (something I've had with other headphones). The microphone plugs into the ear piece using a standard 3.5mm jack and is on an adjustable plastic \"wire\" for want of a better word, so you can adjust this to be as close or as far away from your mouth as you wish. If you don't want to chat, playing a single player game or just listening to music on one of your devices, simply unplug the microphone.\n",
       " \n",

       " Sound Quality.\n",
       " What good are nice comfortable headphones if the sound quality doesn't match up? I'm happy to say that the Spectre headphones have excellent sound reproduction. You can adjust the bass and treble settings on the fly using the in-line amplifier to set the right balance for your particular taste. It handles treble very well without getting too tinny and has a nice deep bass, although I found they do struggle a bit on the very low range bass. I tested this using various songs connected to my iPad as well as connecting to my Xbox and Playstation. In game sound is excellent and you have separate controls on the in-line amplifier to boost chat and/or game music as well as your microphone level. So if you want you can turn the in-game music down, turn chat up and concentrate on chatting with your friends online or vice versa. Play the game whichever way you want. This Dynamic Chat Boost technology works extremely well when the action gets frantic and there are lots of people talking (or yelling), making their voices nice and crisp and easily understood.\n",

       " Halo 4 is by all accounts an exceptional game. 343 Industries first internally developed Halo game impresses on pretty much every front. From high quality production values, to a buttery smooth framerate 99.999% of the time, to the best graphics the series has ever seen, to a more interesting story between Chief and Cortana, etc. Halo 4 is Halo at its best.\n",
       " \n",
       " Firstly, Halo 4 plays like a dream. Similar to previous Halo's, gun combat is very satisfying, but now it's more visceral and impactful than ever before. If anyone says this is Call of Duty, that's hogwash. Other than the inclusion of sprinting, this very much feels like Halo, just improved and more polished than ever. The action is much more buttery smooth than Reach was, which makes playing a complete pleasure.\n",
       " \n",
       " Secondly, the graphics are a massive upgrade from previous Halo's. Previous Halo's lacked quite a bit when it came to character models and animations, but Halo 4 has some of the best looking character models and animations in all of gaming. It's shocking just how much of a leap these two things are from the Halo's that came before it. Going from Halo 3 to Halo 4 shows almost a full generational leap in things like lighting, character models, and animations. In addition, Halo 4 runs in native 720p resolution, which is a first for the Halo franchise, as Halo 3, ODST, and Reach all ran at upscaled 720p. To get that full native 720p resolution, Halo 4 is locked at 30 frames-per-second, and it's a wise choice. Unlike Reach, which had a framerate that varied wildly at times, Halo 4 is pretty much consistent and performs beautifully, even when under pressure from a lot of on-screen action. 343 Industries should be commended for such a technological feat as their first project. It's very impressive.\n",
       " \n",
       " Thirdly, the story's actually incredibly compelling. While some things aren't always crystal clear, it's mostly smooth and cohesive the majority of the time. The relationship between Master Chief and Cortana will hook you from the beginning of the game and until you reach the credits at the finale. Halo 4 is a tightly knit production that offers excellence in story, visual quality, and sound quality. It's truly a masterful game from a first time studio.\n",
       " \n",
       " As someone who has enjoyed the other Halo games this generation, I didn't fall in love with them, so it's shocking to me that Halo 4 has hit the nail on the head in pretty much everything it set out to do.

Unfortunately I had to return the console as it stopped working after a month of owning it. I purchased the game and borrowed an Xbox360 console from one of my friends so here's my review.\n",
       " \n",
       " Being this a sequel of a game that was a breakthrough in game play and graphics, it was supposed this would be better that the first version. While there are a lot of new features and new weapons, I still think the first one is way better than NG2.\n",
       " \n",
       " Some enhancements made are welcome and some of them were needed, the problem is that many of these changes affect directly the game in a major decrease of the level of difficulty. I recall the first NG to be a very difficult game even in easy mode (called Acolyte in NG2), NG2 on the other hand feels a very easy game compared to the previous one even when playing in `Path of the Warrior' which is next to easy. You start gathering new weapons very early in the game and if you get to master the ultimate techniques, it is quite easy to upgrade your weapons to a maximum level very early in the game, by using more powerful weapons it is of course easier to get rid of the `difficult' enemies in later levels. Another change is the auto healing system, you get into a fight with a certain level of energy, after you defeat all enemies on screen your life bar will regenerate to almost the same level of energy you had before starting to fight, which leaves all the healing items to be useless unless you are fighting a boss. Team Ninja did not think the auto healing was enough and made another change, each time you reach a save point and save, your energy bar is filled to its maximum. To me, all this auto healing system takes away the emotion and stress of seeing your life bar decrease in the middle of a fight.\n",
       " \n",
       " The graphics are definitely better than before, the stages are beautifully designed aesthetically, however, programmers failed when designing some of the levels as there are these `invisible' barriers in a lot of places that you cannot go through even though in many situations, these places behind these `barriers' are reachable by going around them. The camera movement is poorly designed and most annoying, using an ultimate technique or combo may result in a messy movement in which you may not see anything at all of what's happening on screen, I recall this being a small issue on the original game but this time the camera problem is SERIOUS. The story that was developed for this sequel is the most nonsense story I have ever seen even for a video game (in one of the stages one of the `Greater fiends' actually invites you to a Colosseum to fight him as he had been searching for a `worthy' opponent, all this as an excuse for a huge battle in the mentioned Colosseum) Fortunately, the game is filled with action and the plot only serves to set up the cinematic battles and sequences for Ryu Hayabusa.\n",
       " \n",
       " The almost perfect sceneries and all the action compensate for this game. There are very few calm moments during the game, opposite to NG in which you fought groups of ninjas/enemies and some fooled around while you were engaged in combat with one of them, in this one, all of them will be attacking you at the same time so you'd better learn some combos or rely on ultimate techniques as enemies will be all around you. Battles are intense and leave no time to catch your breath until all enemies are defeated (after you kill the boss I mentioned in the Colosseum, all the enemies watching the battle in the audience will attack you, you'd think that defeating the boss would be the end of it), in many cases you'll fight a boss and kill it only to see a cutscene that puts you into battle with another fiend immediately after that (be careful when fighting the Armadillo, when defeated make sure you block as it explodes and can kill you) . Enemies that play the role of bosses or mid bosses will appear as regular enemies in later stages... sounds difficult? Don't worry, we now have autohealing!\n",
       " \n",
       " I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the game, I actually like it very much and have been playing it like crazy, NG had unlockables and hidden items that gave extra value to replay, NG2 does not have anything at all (at least not that I'm aware of) but it's still a great game to play, stages are incredible, longer and filled with action, there are things I didn't like but there are others I just thought were great and I will not mention as I wouldn't want to spoil a few surprises.\n",

       " It provides an great workout. I do Aerobics on it everyday for an hour. 30 min. on the Free Step(which is like Step Aerobics), and 30 mins of Free Run. I actually monitor my heart rate and it always puts me in the Fat burning Zone for my age. When I have spare time during the day, I make sure I do some Yoga and Strength Training. On the weekends I play the Balance games with my nephew. So if you have kids this is where you can play some games together and have some bonding time. It is really fun, amusing and tiring. You will break a sweat for sure.\n",
       " \n",
       " I have lost weight and kept it off. I am losing about 4 to 6 pounds a month. It is very easy and motivating because the Wii Fit is tracking your weight and BMI. There is no lying to the Wii Fit regarding your fitness. I believe it was that hard jolt of reality that I was unfit, and seeing it on the wide screen, that motivated me to get those Weight and BMI numbers down. It became a challege. Every week that I check my weight and BMI, I take pride in seeing how much time I have spent on it and how much I have achieved. This is where other exercise equipment are lacking. They lack this sort of follow through and intelligence. It is like having your own personal Trainer in the gym monitoring your progress. That is very motivating for me.\n",
       " \n",
       " If you are into Yoga already, it isn't like your yoga class where you transition from one pose to the other. Here you will need to hold your pose, in perfect balance for about a minute. Once you are done with that pose, you are then free to select the next pose. So you can mix up your routines everyday. What is nice is it knows if you are in balance because you will actually see your center of gravity on the screen so that you can see if you are wobbly or out of balance. I started out falling from the balance board a lot because those poses are reaaaaaaaaaaaaaalllllly DIFFICULT!!! I was swearing half the time. But I took it on as a challenge. Obviously over time, my balance and flexibility improved. I stopped falling and started getting good scores. I guess that is the difference between a yoga class and a yoga session on the Wii. The Wii will grade your performance so you can see your progress over time. Very good for motivation. On days where I lack motivation, I just look at my progress chart over 3 months to see how far I have come. It gives me a sense of pride and achievement. You don't get that on a treadmill.\n",

This will help you become fit if you use it regularly. I have bought exercise equipment in the past, like a treadmill and a stationary bike. They eventually became the place where my wife hangs my clothes after they come out of the dryer. It was hilarious. The reason I stopped using those is that they were extremely boring, and there was no motivation. I was watching a timer and a calorie counter.\n",

I am looking forward to the next generation of Wii Fit. I am sure it will have more team fitness routines.\n",

You're parked at the back of a runway of a small airfield with just one runway. Off in the distance, a huge dark tower looms, piercing the sky. What could just be the start of a Steven King novel or an episode of \"Twilight Zone\" is just the latest and prettiest edition of Microsoft Flight Simulator. Those who've flown older versions of MSFS will know what to expect - better graphics and sound, a database of airports and airspace, more included aircraft, better looking aircraft for those you can add-on (using 3rd party files) and a customizable editor that allows you to choose where, when and how you will go, and what color 747 or F-16 will get you there. FS2002 also continues MS's tradition of incorporating features of 3rd party add-on software offered on older versions of FS. FS2002 comes with a speaking interactive ATC (though others had \"added\" ATC years ago) to go along with all of those verbal lessons (FS2002, like FS2000, comes with a speaking flight instructor, though the new one seems as prone to getting hung-up as the old one). The tweaked graphics engine seems to allow for more realistic texturing of airplanes (from the glossy finish of a freshly built Mustang to the flat black of an SR-71), and more acceptable realistic movement of animated flight-control surfaces, flaps and landing gear. In addition to exteriors, panels and flight models, add-on aircraft now have \"effects\" (contrails, afterburner). Ground texture is also improved over FS2000, making for much more convincing low-level flight. Instead of the stiff blue of the water in older versions of FS, rivers, seas and oceans have waves in FS2002, probably to highlight the inclusion of seaplanes.\n",

       " While nothing will rock your socks off in FS2002, it's a solid and enjoyable sim that allows itself to be pretty much what the individual user wants it to - from an entry-level sim to a challenging one. I ran this program smoothly on my P4 HT w/WinXP & a PCI graphics card.\n",

Maybe you DON't have a dual-core machine, or a late-model P4 system with AGP graphics. FS2004 is clearly a superior product, and will run pretty decent on my above system, but only with settings turned down for traffic. While the 2004 weather generator is positively gorgeous on my system, frame-rate remained acceptable only with traffic set to sparse - which gave an experience gloomily reminiscent of some late 1980's flight sim. The differences between 2002 and 2004 are noticeable, but not so spectacular that owners of 2002 should junk it for 2004, or even that people who never owned either should opt for the newer game. In short, unless you've got about 2+ ghz AND AGP graphics, FS2002 remains competitive with FS2004 and a great value.\" - 509 Tokens,\n",

There is a lot of dialogue but the cases are quite intriguing and it's fun being inside your own Law and Order episode.

Some of it is a little vague as well and most of the solutions were usually something beyond what you thought that you kind of go \"oh yeah, obviously I would've thought of that\". For example, one statement stumped me for a long time and it was only later that I found out that it had something to do with the color of the evidence which wasn't something that even crossed my mind. Another complaint is that during the investigation phase, you might find progress impeded and you can't figure out how to advance and it's only by presenting a certain piece of evidence that something will happen so I found it was just best to present every thing I had to everybody.\n",

I absolutely loved the freedom in Sims 3 and every now and then, I will fire up The Sims 3 and check on the first house I played on in Sunset Valley. Even when I switched PCs and lost all my data, I would still go back and make a family in that one house just because I liked the feel of it. I guess I loved all the experiences that came with this game; The ghosts, reviving families, chances to get the Grim Reaper in your family, random events, and of course the wacky experiences within the whole neighborhood.\n",

What they didn't say was that it's almost impossible to use the PS2 gun as a fully functioning controller, which is what you really need to do.

Now, if you try holding the gun in a standard \"aiming\" style, you'll soon realise that your fingers are in nowhere near the right position to be able to reach it. You could just hold the gun wrongly and reach it, but you need to be able to fire at the screen regularly to kill dinosaurs. And they don't sit still waiting to be shot! So for most of the game you need to be able to move and fire at the same time. And guess what? It's impossible. Bravo, Capcom. Oh, sorry, they didn't stop there, but added a further control scheme to allow you to strafe. To do this you need still more fingers so that you can still press the directional pad, along with two further buttons way down on the gun barrel at the same time. And be able to pull the trigger. But even that's the end of it - if you want still more pain, try using sniper mode!\n",

Which is a shame, because a free-roaming game about shooting dinosaurs is a very exciting idea. And Dino Stalker is otherwise presented very well. The graphics are very good and the monsters all look very impressive. Some stages are really good fun but my favourite ones are those when you are riding some kind of vehicle, which means you don't have to worry about movement at all - hooray! The levels where you get chased down a tunnel by an enraged T-Rex are probably the most fun in the game. The rest is ruined by the controls, which make your life hell. I'll tell you something else too - most levels have a TIME LIMIT!! In case you thought a slow careful hunt would save your fingers, this has been rendered an impossibility by the levels having a clock that counts down to zero - so if you don't rush through the stage, it's game over for you. Kind of negates the joy of free-roaming, doesn't it? You are basically stuck with dashing from point A to point B, killing everything that moves...might as well be on rails. I don't know why this stupid condition was added, as Dino Stalker was not created to be an arcade game.\n",

The bad news is that the implementation badly lacks character balance and bug fixes have been cruelly slow - one reason why player turnover has been very high.\n",

Having not watched the films in a while, I was startled to discover how well they pulled from the soundtracks - songs I thought were SWG-specific actually were nicely hidden in the film. Very well done. Only drawback is you need at least a 2 GHz PC and 64MB of video for the graphics to work well; this game has probably lead to more hardware upgrades than anything since Wing Commander back in the early 90s. The cameos of Vader, the Emperor, and other small touches (Ben Kenobi's hut for instance) work.\n",

Multiple worlds mean you have a huge variety of mobs to shoot/punch/slice/attack with your pet, and once you get tired of the varying levels of mobs, you can turn to quests, and then once you get tired of that, you can turn entirely to PvP and killing every Rebel or Imperial you can find. It is simply staggering to see how long you can find yourself at your PC playing this. One side benefit is that unlike many games, this can be played - if a little jerky - on 56K dialup.\n",
       " The two problems that respectively knock off a star each are game balance and development/customer support. Support is easier to explain; Sony Online essentially ignores lost item requests and player harassment. The solution to an overwhelming number of complaints was not to hire more reps but instead to lock down any players' ability to file an 'issue' from originally multiple ones to 3 to 1 outstanding at any time, which usually takes several days to get a CSR to respond. It is simply the worst customer service I've ever seen in a MMPORG, especially dangerous given the level of PVP and potential abuses many players get away with under it.\n",
       " Second, game balance is skewed dramatically toward the blast-and-kill player. While the game set out to do a lot by having something like 30 different classes, unfortunately the designers left too many holes open for very powerful blast-and-kill characters to be able to solo difficult mob missions. Once the requirement for group play went out the window, this meant support characters like doctors and crafters simply could not be played as primary characters. Between this and a number of bugs early on that created billions of in-game credits for other players, inflation became rampant on many servers and it has become increasingly difficult for new players to get to the same level of power old ones obtain (hence the newbie unfriendliness many people discuss).\n",

There are certain shopkeepers and traders that have key ingredients but they are few and far apart. It was only toward the end where I had plenty of max healing potions either to buy or make.

(Heck, I would say that it's a good rental too, but since no store would even have it these days, good luck with that.)\n",
       " \n",
       " I really loved this game. Other reviewers have said it and I agree. When it comes to Movie/Game Tie-ins, \"The Thing\" got it right. That doesn't happen often. It's the rare breed of video game that does go well with the movie, or well enough at least. The only one I can think of that did it better is \"Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay\". But that game was a prequel, instead of a sequel. Other games could learn a lot from these movie adaptations. (Are you listening, \"Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler's Green\"???)\n",

But it's not bad, really. You wouldn't expect a lot of varied colors inside an Antarctic base, which is where most of the action in this game takes place. It all serves its purpose.\n",

Plus, it all boils down to something really simple anyway: Bad guys try to run experiments on The Thing; the experiments go bad (or good, from the Thing's point of view); Thing tries to take over the world. The rest was just ancillary.\n",
       " \n",
       " I liked the outdoor snow scenes. The interior of the bases were fairly monotonous. Some of it got kind of old, seeing the same style corridors and doors over and over.

       " \n",
       " Some of it was limited by the graphical qualities of the early xbox, but even so, it is something special. The whole game experience leads to something that - while not being exactly frightening - is certainly creepy and memorable. All of it feeds a very effective feeling of isolation; it's you against the world. Which may be one of the reasons I preferred to play this alone at 1:00 in the morning...\n",
       " \n",
       " While the graphical nuts and bolts of each level were repetitive, the level designs themselves were very inventive. I was surprised at how much cool stuff there was to do, and at the difficulty levels of the tasks to which you were assigned. Many of them called on you to use your brain quite a bit, as going in guns blazing just wouldn't cut it.\n",
       " \n",
       " And that does bring me to one facet of the game that you will likely find as frustrating as I: the Difficulty. The Thing is a HARD game. If you play it, you will die. Not once, but many times. As someone who once beat Mike Tyson on Punch-Out, and more recently, has beaten \"Ninja Gaiden Black\" on Master Ninja mode, I am no stranger to difficult games. But this is something else. Many parts of this game are simply hell on earth to get through, causing you to play through them again and again... You better have a high tolerance for that, or else you'll beating your controller - or your head - against the wall.\n",
       " \n",
       " Some of this is due to poor design. The save stations are few and far between. And the controls are a bit clunky. The item and weapon inventory are both keyed to the D-pad, only in different directions. So lots of times when you are trying to switch weapons, which you'll be doing a lot since you need the flamethrower to finish off Things, you'll accidentally go the wrong way and not be able to get it in time. All while being rushed by the enemy and killed. Or you might accidentally switch from your Medpacks to a grenade, which can really screw you over.\n",
       " \n",
       " Another annoyance is that crouching is tied into depressing the control stick. So lots of times in the middle of a fight, you'll end up crawling around when you want to be running.\n",
       " \n",
       " But by far the worst is the amount of save stations. Especially toward the end, where there's one particularly grueling area. You have to get out of a burning station, and then fight your way through a snowy canyon, sniping a good three dozen (at least) enemy soldiers. This was the hardest part of the game, and there was no place to save. Luckily, restarting the level keeps you at the beginning point of that. But if you don't make it through after your first hour of trying (and trust me, you won't), you may be tempted to leave it and try later. There goes your progress.\n",

       " The game touts its Fear and Trust systems. I thought these were a great concept , but like many other reviewers, I found them to be worthless in practice. If they game were truly squad-based it might matter. But the team members you get only remain generic NPC's, and never develop into anything worthwhile. You don't care if they trust you, because 9 times out of 10 you won't need any of them anyway. By the time you reach the end of the level, any of them that have survived simply disappear mysteriously, unable to progress through the pre-programmed level.\n",
       " \n",
       " This is my biggest problem with this game. It took an idea that is quite cool, and never really followed up on it. Despite whatever it may claim, this game is a solo effort. The fact that your squadmates are never allowed to join you in the miniboss battles just emphasizes the point.\n",
       " \n",
       " And this is a highlight of the game to me: the Minibosses. There are at least 3, and all of them are hell on earth to actually beat. Most of your dying efforts will consist of just trying to figure out what to do to damage them. None of them are easy at all. The hardest - which actually turned out to be the easiest - was the one with a Thing in a glass booth in the back of the room. The whole time you are fighting, you are trying to keep from shooting that booth, to accidentally let the other Thing out. (Hint: Rapid-fire shotgun, then torch him! You'd better do a good job on this one too, with about 5 health packs left over or so. Because that's all you're going to be getting for a LOOONG time, buddy!)\n",

They keep introducing new battle elements deep into the game so things stay fresh. The story is immensely deep and it moves at a swift enough pace to keep you with it. The only thing this game suffers from is a slight lack of creativity. It has the usual RPG trimming of rat monsters to start, the same base creature with new skins to represent new monsters, the item that identifies what the monesters HP and abilities are.

I am not a fan of PS2, but I was curious about the game. I had hoped that the game would be satisfying to the point of being a good football game, a worthwhile game to play. Alas, it turned out not for me. My greatest fear was quickly realized: too many buttons on the controller, thus a very complicated gameplay. The more I played the game, the less I liked it. The longer I went with the game, the more my wrists and fingers hurt. I was more annoyed by the long pauses and loading times during the waiting periods and most especially between plays of the game. I was like, \"Just freaking snap the ball and get on with the drive\" or \"Loading for what? What's taking so long? Let's get moving.\" I swear that it was like being trapped being forced to watch the endlessly long commercials during an actual NFL game. I found the complicated buttons for different moves utterly ridiculous. I couldn't even remember everything for players in different positions, offense and defense. I was like, \"Why can't there be a single button for everything, only that I'll trust the player's discretion to make a move best suited for the moment?\" That would have simplified everything for me. Anyway, I am from old school, and my days were filled with Atari and 8 bit Nintendo. To this day, the greatest football game ever made was Tecmo Bowl. Later, it got replaced with Tecmo Super Bowl. Anyone who has played the game will quickly agree with me. The game play is so absurdly simple; the action is quick and fast; and there are no pauses between plays. It just flows well, and the game per se rewards back with a lot of great moments. The celebrations in the end, also the dramatic moments, are the best parts of the game.

With a garage of over 20 vehicles, I hadn't realized I had yet to actually purchase one until that point. There's also the Forza Hub - a separate app on the Xbox that provides in-game rewards to all of your Forza games. As someone who's played all but one of those titles, and been a VIP member of all but maybe 2, I get a ridiculous amount of in-game currency that virtually negates the REASON to play it in the first place. I remember grinding in old games, running races over and over again just to afford that next dream car, and upgrade it to the hilt. At the time I remember thinking it was a chore, until I realized that I was probably so familiar with those virtual tracks that I could take my REAL sports car out there and probably turn in a pretty decent time.

It's the same game, but there are enough differences to justify owning the console version in addition to the PC version. Firstly, split-screen multiplayer. This is probably the biggest plus for the console edition. You can play with up to four players on your console, and those players can enter your game at any point as you're playing. You just need to be running the console in HD. (I use a generic HDMI cable.) It's great fun with friends! Secondly, this edition cannot generate an \"infinite\" world. Whether above ground or beneath, you will eventually run into an invisible wall. Some will disagree, but I think of this as a plus. A limited (but still rather large) world means you can fill in your world map and explore in a way that feels more immediately rewarding, and you won't get lost as long as you have your map. Thirdly, the vastly improved crafting system. No longer must you arrange items in specific ways on a grid (often having to look up the various recipes because it's otherwise too cryptic). When you enter the crafting menu it shows you the items you can make and what you need to make them. As long as you have what you need you just select the item you want and it's made! Simple as that. Finally, the game looks and plays wonderfully on the tv and with the Xbox controller. As soon as you start playing it feels like an upgrade to the Minecraft experience, not a console rehash.

There is a lot of customization that can be done and I'll do my best to capture that in the next section ('software')\n",

This is great for switching CPI on the fly between regular use and say a specific game where more CPI is advantageous.\n",

       " \n",
       " First off let's talk about Banjo Kazooie's story. Banjo's sister Tooty is kidnapped by the wicked witch Gruntilda. Gruntilda has planned on swapping Tooty's beauty to her, but not if Banjo and his friend Kazooie can help it! Okay, seriously this story is pretty lame, but hey! It's a game. In My opinion, no matter how good the graphics are, or how great the story is, it all boils down to one thing. And that's gameplay. And Banjo Kazooie has fantastic gameplay.\n",

       " In Banjo Kazooie you play as Banjo and...well...Kazooie, and Kazooie stays inside Banjo's backpack at all times, but she's not useless. They both work as a team and learn many moves, which brings us to our next character, Bottles. Bottles the mole helps you learn different moves to help you defeat Gruntilda and rescue Tooty. But do you just walk up to Gruntilda and save Tooty? Not at all, there are several items to collect to defeat Gruntilda. The most important one is jiggies, there are ten jiggies in each world and you need several items to collect them. Along the way Bottles teaches you to use certain items, such as eggs to shoot through Kazooie's mouth, or how to fly when you collect enough feathers. Another essential item to collect is mumbo tokens. Gruntilda has hidden mumbo tokens all around her enormous lair and if you collect enough you can visit the great shaman Mumbo Jumbo and he will transform you into different creatures to help you along your journey. So you have plenty to do in this game, I can guarantee that. Another essential item are music notes, in each world one hundred music notes are scattered all around and if you collect enough you can open new doors in Gruntilda's massive lair. But I do find it to become quite tedious sometimes. Why? You may ask. Because each time you leave and re-enter a world all the notes are still there, no matter how many you've collected. Let's say you've collected ninety-nine out of the hundred possible music notes to collect, well if you leave the world and re-enter, you would have to collect all ninety nine notes again, you couldn't go searching for the one music note you hadn't collected. And while yet this situation is highly unlikely, it's still annoying no matter how many notes you have to re-collect. Fortunately, if you don't care about collecting all one hundred music notes, you don't have to because the game automatically saves the amount you've collected.\n",

But I did get frustrated with a feature that was not added in the game, I wish Banjo could hang on to ledges, there was many times in Clanker's Cavern where I could almost reach a ledge, but it was just barely out of reach because I couldn't hang on to the ledge. While yet this wasn't too big of a deal, I think that feature could of made the game a little less frustrating.

I will admit I did need help online for a few jiggies, but the ending sequence makes the occasional frustrations all worthwhile, very satisfying if you ask me.

The stylus was a bit awkward at first, but the levels seemed to be designed with this in mind, so you had plenty of time to get comfortable before needing to do anything with a great deal of efficiency. Combat is the only area where adjusting to the stylus seems like a gimick, or just a hassle to make it a \"DS game\", everything else the stylus does (navigating the ship, drawing on maps, making notes for yourself, drawing paths for boomerangs, grappling hooks and bombchus) is a MAJOR convenience. I felt ridiculous having to take pen and paper notes while playing Wind Waker, just so that I could remember where things were on that absurdly large map. If I want to remember a special feature of an island in Phantom Hourglass though, all I have to do is write on the map!\n",

The music is pretty bland in the context of other Zelda titles, but this doesn't detract from the game at all so it's no big deal. All of the usual suspects are there as far as items go (boomerang, bow, hookshot/grapple, hammer, shovel) but the stylus control gives a few of them (especially the boomerang) a make over that expands their usefulness. The lack of bottles and heart pieces was kind of weird, but not a deal breaker by any means.\n",
       " \n",
       " Not everything about this game is great though. It is pretty easy, which wouldn't be a negative, but there are times when your helper fairy (there has been some version of this in every Zelda game since Ocarina of Time) literally walks you through puzzles. I don't know if it is because they expect a younger audience on a handheld (minish cap was really bad about this as well), but I do not like this, it takes away from my favorite part of the game (ie getting that euphoric jolt of accomplishment when I solve a puzzle all on my own!).\n",

       " Then there is the combat. Wow, talk about a step back! It started with Legend of Zelda: Four Swords, and continued in Wind Waker, where it felt like the designers had put a lot of thought into making the combat exciting and chaotic. It was special because for the first time ever it felt like there was an element of skill involved with Zelda combat. If you knew a few moves and how to use your items effectively, you could take on dozens of enemies at once... and you were given several opportunities to do so! This was exciting! Twilight Princess altered things slightly, going from a 'take on the world' combat ideology, to more of a stealthy/duel based ideology. So while you didn't have the chaos of the aforementioned titles, there was still plenty of intensity and skill in the combat sequences. But in the Phantom Hourglass, you hardly fight at all! I understand that part of this has to do with the physical limitations inherent with the stylus control scheme (ie no targetting, only 1 item equipped at a time etc.), but it is still disappointing.\n",

The Uplay prevent me use the MSI Afterburner to check the FPS and temp of my GPU. As soon as I turn on MSI Afterburner. Far Cry 4 stops working. Forget about recording your gameplay for Youtube channel. UNLESS, you crack it. Then everything will be fine. So that means, you cannot record your multiplayer experience with the software provided by your GPU. I got Far Cry 4 because of getting the NVIDIA GTX 980. So there should be all support cooperation between Ubisoft and NVIDIA. But not at this one particular game.\n",

Having played many Blizzard games I kept giving this trash the benefit of the doubt but finally realized it was nothing but Blizzard fan boys talking and quit.\n",
       " \n",
       " I believed in Blizzard Entertainment. I really, really did. From the start the game is doomed as the story has more holes than a block of Swiss cheese. Then you're expected to play the game in a group where one guy always clicks skip story. Playing solo is futile as your gear drops will be for another class, thus you need different classes in your group to share the loot. Sounds pretty stupid right? It is trust me. What if the other guy in the group doesn't want to share? You get nothing. Fun huh? So at this point you're stuck buying gear off the auction house for either millions of gold or real money. This game is all about the fun of looking on the auction house for gear to beat a level. Pure fail Blizzard! Pure fail!\n",

They refused to finish the first difficulty as they literally danced in the fire, intentionally got hit, and never died. They said the game was crap and quit. The game doesn't get decent until the 3rd time you've played it through. So you have to play the exact same game 3 times before you get a challenge unless you fall asleep at the keyboard from boredom and die. If you get to a section you can't get past just buy some gear off the auction house and more than likely you're back to god mode again.\n",

I play a Demon Hunter and most everything can one shot you unless you invested hundreds of million in gold into your gear. Then you can last for 3 hits! So assume you're not the type of person to spend real money on the auction house. So you're going to get a ton of one hit deaths when you try to kill elite mobs. You might die 9 times to a mob if you're not spending real money on gear. Repair bill will be close to 50,000 gold. The mob will drop about 3,000 gold in items and money. So then you get in a group and pray that the mob decides to chase another person. But there are tons more of them so you still die over and over. Sounds like fun huh?

That makes the game even more fun with lag!\n",

Initially, I was excited to get an Nvidia product to stream games from my already powerful PC rig which runs on a GTX 980 Ti ($700+ GPU). According to GeForce Experience and Nvidia's customer service, I've got more than enough horsepower to stream games from my PC to the Shield. Wow, that couldn't be far from the truth. The 'GRID' service is great, however, it is only free for a LIMITED time. This reeks of Xbox Live and Playstation Network subscription fees (and it will eventually be a paid subscription model with 'tiers'). As if dropping $200+ on this streamer to work side by side with a PC armed with an Nvidia GPU that's about $700 wasn't enough! Sure Nvidia, take more of my money. Playing games on the GRID reminded me of Xbox 360 graphics quality. A lot of jaggies but an average of 60fps, which is good. The really frustrating part is the actual advertising that you can STREAM games from your existing PC. You would think that this shouldn't be a big deal, but it is. Right now, peruse Nvidia's forums and you will see a ton of people venting their frustrations on why the Nvidia Shield keeps stating their PC is 'offline'. Worst yet, Nvidia's ads say you can play games \"on the go\". It's a lot trickier than that. Nvidia's customer service stated that I should download an older version of GeForce Experience BETA to simply stream anything from my PC.

My home network has over 150+ Mbps down and 20Mbps up. The only way I got this to actually work acceptably for streaming stuff from my PC to the Shield was to connect the Shield via Ethernet to the router..... which is literally a few feet from my computer! So much for streaming remotely or for running this thing in another location in my house. Look, if you're looking for a media streamer only, there are cheaper alternatives.

In SH1 and 2, this was the protagonist, Yuri, and it was a major plot point in both games. In this game it is the pretty, scantily clad, native American girl who joins you early on. It is a plot point to a degree as you are on a quest for her to visit various earth spirits and gain their elemental forms, but it is more ancillary. You travel rather large segments of the world, meeting people, fighting evil, and preparing for the ultimate confrontation. There's plenty of treasure and side quests and such to be found. It sticks to the major tropes and does them very, very well.\n",

       " \n",
       " You start the game as a man called Stocke, an employee of the Specint (short for \"Special Intelligence\", if you didn't pick that up) group. In a nutshell, you are assigned special missions, ranging from minor creature attacks to escorting people from place to place. Your employer, Heiss, calls you into the office for a new assignment. As part of this, he hands you a White Chronicle, a key item in the game's progression (though you are unaware of this at the time), and asks you to discover its secrets.\n",
       " \n",
       " Radiant is very long in the tooth when it comes to true gameplay. Where it shines, or at least tries to, is the telling of its story. Ironically enough, the story is actually quite good. Without spoiling anything, you are one of two Chronicle holders, and the Chronicle gives you the power to go back to key events along one of two timelines, altering the path of the other as you go. It's an intriguing concept and one that is also difficult to do in video games and movies, especially since nobody really has a true grasp of the inner workings of \"time travel\". Fortunately, in Radiant, you're not actually traveling through just time. Actually, you're traveling through what some think to be the 4th dimension - where you are not reliving points of your own history and seeing yourself as you were, but rather that you're folding time in such a way that you are moving back and forth along a linear timeline. The reason this makes sense is that you don't lose any of your experiences or memories when you do these leaps. In fact, your memories are key to the reason you're doing the move, and there are times you'll be called upon to fight more dangerous creatures during a leap to the past that you know weren't there before. But again, another Chronicle holder is dancing around time causing issues.\n",
       " \n",
       " The best analogy I can think of: anyone who's watched Quantum Leap and remembers the Evil Leaper dual-part episode, that's basically what's going on here.\n",
       " \n",
       " I mentioned that Radiant was at least making a solid attempt to tell a good story. I say \"attempt\", because though the story is actually a solid one, it's not told well at all. Part of this is not the storyteller's fault; as I mentioned, it's VERY difficult to tell a story about time travel and do it in such a way that it not only makes sense, but is perfectly logical and sensible given all that we know. Since this is a game and not real life, some can be forgiven, but others are just blatant oversights that make you scratch your head in utter confusion. As I mentioned, you'll start out under Heiss' command, and then reach your first key decision which creates your two timelines. It doesn't really matter which you choose first, because no matter what you do you'll have no choice but to jump to the other timeline. In other words, there is no \"perfect scenario\" where time leaping isn't required. This seems funny and almost wrong; it's like you're compelled to change history to benefit you, and you can't help but feel as though the game is made artificially long with this requirement. It's not a bad thing, but it just doesn't feel comfortable for some reason.\n",
       " \n",
       " You'll interact with the same characters in either timeline, but differently. You also will go to the same places, but at different times in each timeline. Where this seems to go wrong is when you want to try and complete the storyline. The game tracks your progress in a timeline map that you can access in-game, and there are side quests where you will be asked to do various things to help complete the story. A lot of these are simple - deliver a letter, find an item, etc. A lot are not. The bulk require you to go back in time and either change something that went wrong, save someone from dying, or find someone that someone else is looking for. In of itself this would not be a problem, but because of the way that timeline map is shown, later in the game it gets extremely difficult to track progress. It seemed to me at times that it would have been more useful to have, instead of a left-right map, just a simple listing of events in a hierarchy with completed tasks starred or grayed out, so I could focus on what was not done without too much scrolling. It's hard to describe without seeing it, but know that by around the middle of the game, I was frustrated trying to figure out what I needed to do next.\n",
       " \n",
       " Also, with trying to do the side events, it's extremely tasking to know exactly where to leap back in time. Sometimes it's obvious, like when a person is at a certain point and you can jump right to that point. Sometimes it isn't, like when someone dies in a cave and you need to figure out how they got there and how they died in order to save them. Many times I ended up clearing side quests without ever really knowing how I did it, and some side quests I never did complete because it was never clear how to get to the point I needed to be in. Because there's no free travel in the game, even if you know that a certain task is in a certain city, you can't just warp to that city. From 90% of the key points you can't even walk to the city freely. The linearity in the game hinders your ability to truly explore all there is and there is only one way to get to everything, which I found a little unsettling. For example, there is one sidequest where you must retrieve a sword from a person who is in a specific town. It doesn't tell you when. It only tells you they are in a town that you only happen to be in from one specific key event. You will then be told that the person \"just left\" the inn, but there are no additional clues as to where they went, and you might assume you need to leap before they got to the inn, but there aren't any such key events.\n",

Your characters are in a normal turn-based line, and you have a turn tracker such as that found in some other turn-based games. Depending on the speed of your characters, you might even get double or even triple turns before your enemy gets a chance to take a turn. All of the usual RPG goodness is here, replete with regular spells, attacks, and special attacks that you learn from scrolls and books. Where this breaks down is in the general strategy. For the most part, I was able to poison every single walking enemy except some shadow enemies near the end of the game. Fire seemed to work even on enemies where they appeared to specialize in the element, and with the exception of the very last boss, I never once felt as though I was at risk of dying. Battles that were a little challenging were only so due to who I was forced to use. Marco, in particular, is good for buffing effects but a horrible fighter, whereas Aht seems to be the most well-rounded of the group, being fully equipped with attack skills, magic, healing, and the fastest on the squad to boot.\n",

Mentally, you'll be tempted to skip saving as you'll feel as though you're effectively immortal, but you want to make sure you remember to save every now and then.

The game play is along the lines of AOE, Civilizations at war, etc., in that you gather resources, build your city and army up to a certain point, (If you last that long,) and wipe out the opposing side. The game is a bit lacking with only three civilizations to choose from, excluding India in the campaign scenarios and, you can become tired of playing the same three over and over again. Of course most of the fighting during that time was between the Persians and Greeks with some mixed minor clashes with the Egyptians so, this part is pretty much accurate.

       " I do not know why, but every gaming headphone I have ever tried on always sounded muddled, muted, and unclear. This included various Turtle Beach, Steelseries, and now the Corsair headphones. I expected crystal clear sound from a supposed 7.1 setup, but I really did not like it. For comparison, I also own and use regularly the Sennheiser HD558, which are not gaming headphones, but can be used for anything (they lack a mic). The sound out of the Sennheiser HD558 is crystal clear, robust, and all around you. The Corsair sounds like they are under water, which is what other gaming headphones sound like. I tested the Corsair on many types of music out of Google Play, and several games, including Borderlands 2, Dying Light, Lego Jurassic Park, and Rocket League (I tried to use a diverse set of games). I can honestly say that the sound experience was subparmy normal PC speakers are Klipsch THX Promedia, and they sound significantly better. I do not think I heard any additional sound effects, such as enemies approaching from behind, which is the reason most gamers want 7.1 surround sound in their headphones. And since the Corsair comes with no software out of the box (I now see some kind of Corsair Utility Engine on their website, but I do not know what it does for these headphones), the only thing I could do was adjust the sound volume in Windows 8.1. If Corsair came with an equalizer, that might help some of these issues. Overall, the sound did not meet my expectations.\n",

The headband was placed across the top of my head. Within seconds, my ears hurt. I was ready to reject them instantly. Luckily, the little booklet it came with shows a picture, and the headband is NOT supposed to go across the top of your head. The headband needs to go on the front of your head towards your hair line. This will angle the ear cups correctly. Once I figured this out, they were much more comfortable. You need to know that these are over-ear cups, so they will create a seal (they are not noise cancelling, but they will block out a great deal of noise). Overall, they were comfortable for about 30 minutes, but I can imagine with a longer break-in period, they will be comfortable longer.\n",

       " Design:\n",
       " The design looks solid, but there is one thing that is already driving me crazy. The ear cups rotate on their own axis. If you hold the right ear cup in your right hand, the entire piece will swivel up, allowing you to look inside the ear cup. I am not sure why Corsair designed it this way, but they swivel with absolutely no resistance. I tried to stretch the headband before putting them on, and the left ear cup swiveled out of my hand, and the entire thing snapped back into my chin. I understand that some swivel helps the headphones sit on different type heads, but they swivel in crazy directions every time I touch them. Maybe Corsair did this so that when you put them down, the ear cushions face up instead of down. Overall, I do not like this feature.\n",

       " The mic is permanently attachedyou cannot remove it. At least the Steelseries can be retracted.

In addition, these are truly PC headphones because they can only be connected via USB. You need to know thisthe Voids cannot be used on a cell phone or a stereo receiver out of the box. I have a laptop with no more free USB ports. Luckily, it worked through a USB 3.0 powered hub. For some people, the lack of extended functionality will be a deal breaker.\n",

       " Although I like Corsair, I did not like these headphones. I would rather plug in a normal pair of high end headphones to my audio jack rather than use these as gaming headphones. Although they are comfortable once you put them on correctly, I do think they are as comfortable as they could be where I could wear them for hours of gaming. I dislike that the ear cups swivel so easily and so often, and dislike the fact that the mic is always attached to the headset.

I won't go into further detail about which Mario games I have played exactly, my point is that I've been playing RPGs and Mario games since I was five years old, and I'm in my 20s now. The first game I ever played was Super Mario Land for the grey brick gameboy....shortly after I played Super Mario World for SNES.

I probably should have watched \"Let's play\" videos about this game, like I usually do. But I didn't, and that was my fault. I thought this game was going to be good, I expected it to be good.\n",

       " \n",
       " The battling is interesting as well. I enjoyed how they made battling a little different in the Dream World than in the real world, having you only play with Mario in the Dream battle sequences, with the opportunity to have Luigi pack a second punch because he \"lives inside Mario\" or whatever. Basically, you see Mario punch an enemy, and then if you hit A at the right time when you are coming down to stomp on an enemy, a bunch of Luigi's will rain pain on that enemy, or all of the ones you are battling. In the real world battle sequences, you just have both Mario and Luigi taking turns battling.\n",
       " \n",
       " The battling is turn based, by the way, much like Final Fantasy X or the Pokemon games in that it is not real time, and you are picking what you do (attack, item, flee) from a menu. The rest of the game you are hopping around, hitting A or B, (A for Mario, B for Luigi) to jump and hit blocks that give you coins, mushrooms (they heal you), or whatever other items. In 3D, like Super Mario World for the 3DS, which I have not played, but I've watched other people play. You also solve puzzles to open various doors...some examples of the puzzles are, they will flash six blocks at you and ask you which one is different from the rest. Nothing too complex, not like playing Tomb Raider or Final Fantasy X which had some complicated puzzles, but puzzles nonetheless. That aspect was alright, I could have managed with some harder challenges, but whatever, I know a lot of children play these games, so that is probably why it is a little easy.\n",
       " \n",
       " Overall, I liked the juxtaposition of RPG turn based gameplay with 3D platforming and puzzle solving. Gives you a little variety, and keeps the gameplay interesting.\n",
       " \n",
       " Like in most RPGs, there is a system of leveling up. The way it works is, you gain EXP for battling, and when you level up either Mario or Luigi, you have the opportunity to add points to your stats, that being speed, jump, attack, defense, HP, etc. You can only pick one stat to level up, unlike other RPGs, you cannot disperse your points across multiple stats. Also, you do not get points to disperse, its more like you pick the stat to level up, and then you hit A and you randomly get to add +1, +2 or +3, depending on when the slot rolling thing stops. This is similar to Super Mario World games, when you go into the mushroom houses, or in the older games, at the end of the level, and you have a chance to get powerups or coins, but its random, you hit a block or slots and you get what you land on. That was cool, I didn't really have a problem with that, I like that they stuck to the Mario way of doing things.\n",
       " \n",
       " During the battles, I forgot to mention, you also have the opportunity to use \"badges\" These badges you find during the game, and they have various special abilities, such as recovering some of your HP when you use them. Both Mario and Luigi get badges, and so depending on how you pair their two badges up, those are the perks you will get. Now, the way you would activate these is by maxing out your overload bar by landing a lot of attacks on the enemy. Basically, during the battle, your bar charges, and when it gets to the end, you have the opportunity to use the perks afforded to you by the badge that you have equipped. Similar to a lot of other games...I've seen this mechanic in FF, in fighting games, etc. Pretty cool, adds more to the battle.\n",
       " \n",
       " Now for the BAD.\n",
       " So it sounds like I really liked the game, and honestly, I did. There is one thing that ruined my experience completely. Which is why I am going to give this game 3 stars, and not any less, because it's not terrible... it just is ruined by TUTORIALS. Tutorial after endless tutorial. And I mean for EVERYTHING. The entire game is taken up by 50% tutorial. Most of which, you cannot turn off. I hated this. It interrupts the gameflow, and its mind numbingly boring. I don't need to know how to use the start screen to equip items, clothes or badges. I also don't need to spend five minutes learning how to pick actions during my turn in battle. I've been playing for years.\n",
       " \n",
       " I know some of you will tell me that all RPGs have tutorials. First of all, that is not true. At least not the way it is in this game. In those games, you have the option to turn the tutorial off, or access it when you need it. You are not forced to listen to it. For example, I was recently replaying FF9 for PSX, and yes there are an abundance of tutorials. However, you don't have to listen to 80% of them. If you want to, you have the option of accessing them and reviewing them. And anyway, that game is far more complex than this game, and requires much more strategy and planning. Not saying this game is not as good, but there is no question about the fact that FF9 just has a more complex battle system, and requires that you learn how to use it if you have never played a Final Fantasy Game.\n",
       " \n",
       " Another thing I had a big problem with was the dialogue. First of all, why are they speaking pseudo French? Weird, and sort of amusing, but kind of random. IMHO. But that wasn't the main concern, the dialogue is just plain, boring and repetitive. Nobody is saying anything of remote importance, and even if they are, it is buried in paragraphs of nonsense. Yes, nonsense. (Non playable characters) NPCs are all saying the same thing, also. I know kids play this game, but don't children have bigger imaginations than adults?? So wouldn't that mean that they would very much enjoy a game where the NPCs are going to be saying interesting things, perhaps revealing stories or opinions about the world you are playing in? Nope. No such luck.\n",
       " \n",
       " The basic story line is you are saving the Pi'llo folk from being trapped in stone pillows by going into the Dream World, and saving Princess Peach every once in a while. Not terribly imaginative, nor does it really make much sense, but Mario games have never been known for their amazing plot-lines. So why then, do we need all this useless dialogue? We don't.\n",
       " \n",
       " Again, I'm sure some of you are thinking that a lot of RPG's have a lot of dialogue. True, but that dialogue makes sense, because you need to listen to it to learn more about the lore, and therefore get more immersed in the games' world. Either that or just to get vital information about what to do next. The dialogue serves a purpose. And anyway, in a lot of games, you choose to talk to people and converse with them, such as in Skyrim. You don't HAVE to talk to them. In this game, you progress to part of the game where you get to a little cutscene, and you have to listen to some block dude (pi'llo people) ramble about some nonsense for 5 paragraphs. Usually what they are saying could just be cut down to a sentence, ok I get it, I need to go attack a boss who has captured Peach, I don't need an essay about that. And anyway, I found myself just tapping A furiously through the dialogue in order to get it over with. It felt like I was missing out on something, and I hated the fact that I had to do that. I should WANT to read through what the characters are saying, otherwise what is the point?\n",
       " \n",
       " So to sum it up, I really would have liked this game if I weren't constantly being stopped to learn how to do simple things, and if the dialogue were either cutdown, or more interesting. Mario games should not try to be like Skyrim or Fallout or FF with the dialogue, we all know that the plot is simple, and the fun of the game lies in the GAMEPLAY. In this case, the gameplay takes a backseat to the chatter and tutorials. Yes it is fun to play once you are playing, but again, it is being interrupted constantly, and with no option to turn it off. This continues throughout most of the game. I was not able to finish it, but I did log in about 15 hours. And I'm still doing tutorials. I couldn't take it anymore, I turned it off. I'm a completionist too, I've beat about every game I listed in my opening paragraph, and I only quit games halfway through if I am miserable playing them, much like this game.\n",
       " \n",
       " If you can overlook the negative aspects that I listed, then by all means, buy this game. But if you are one of those gamers who is really experienced in RPGs as well as Mario, you are going to be greatly annoyed. Especially if you don't like \"hand-holding games\"\n",
       " \n",
       " My suggestion to Nintendo is to have difficulty levels. This is what a lot of games do, and I don't understand why they cannot just do that, it is a mechanic that has been around for at least 15 years. I know the old-school games did not have that option, but nowadays nearly every game has a novice, medium, and hard setting. The novice setting could be filled with tutorials, and easier gameplay, and the other difficulty settings could omit that kind of thing.\n",

If this were any other game, people would be complaining about this stuff, and this game would never receive 5 stars or 4 stars as an average review. But because it is Mario, it's ok. The explanation is that \"That's how Mario games are, they have no plot and they are silly\". Yeah ok, so that is just what it is going to be for another 25 years? This is exactly why Nintendo does not innovate with Mario much. Actually at all. Other games have progressed leaps and bounds while Mario games stay exactly the same. In fact, Mario games have not changed at all in the past 15 years, save for crisper pixels and 3D. People go out and buy every Mario game just because it is Mario. In fact, I am guilty of the same thing, seeing as I blindly bought a 3DS with this game preloaded... and I have blindly bought all the handheld mario games, including kart and the mario sports games.

       " Fable II is another Western RPG that really tries to use a lot of action mixed with RPG elements and tagging a good story in it. Fable was a big deal when it came out because it was one of the few games that let you choose to be good or evil with every single task they threw out at you. Everything you did affected how the game turned out and these included things from terrorizing towns with crude expressions to giving money to a church. Fable II continues this is tons of things for you to do and tons of way to go about doing so. When you start the game out your introduced to the story and you get to choose your main character; whether it be a boy or a girl is your choice. As a child you go about performing small tasks to get used to the idea of how to play the game. These range from finding things for people to helping children fend off bullies. This is also a crucial point in the game for heading down your good or evil path. You can choose to give arrest warrants that you find to the sheriff or give them to the criminals for a reward.\n",
       " \n",
       " The whole game evolves like this and it really makes an impact later on. Once you get the hang of the game you can equip better weapons, buy food, potions etc. One great thing about Fable II is that you get a dog by your side and he helps you hunt out treasure chests and places to dig. You can upgrade him by finding or buying books that will upgrade his treasuring hunting abilities. Your dog also helps you in battle and if he gets to hurt you can heal him; also, mind you, that he can play a part in expressions (more on those later). Surprisingly the AI for the dog is done very well and he looks, sounds, and acts like a real dog. Rarely did he get in the way or couldn't find his way around an obstacle, and same goes for enemies as well. While you can buy more powerful weapons (blunt, slashing, stabbing you know the type) to kill enemies there is no armor for you to buy.\n",
       " \n",
       " All you can do is buy clothes and these just add to your looks which effects other things in the game (more on socializing later). The game consists of three different elements to upgrade with and that's skill (ranged weapons), will (magic), and strength (melee). You upgrade yourself by absorbing the appropriate orbs after defeating an enemy or using the appropriate potion. It takes awhile to start getting the higher level stuff, but once you get further into the game you earn experience more quickly. You can customize your character a lot by buying tattoos, getting makeup done etc. You can also even dye your clothes now which is cool.\n",
       " \n",
       " Combat in the game is pretty simple yet satisfying: You use X to attack, Y for ranged, B for magic. Melee attacks can be charged while ranged weapons have other abilities like a TPS (third person shooter) mode, lock on etc. Magic is a bit different this time around since you have a \"Magic Tree\" that you access by holding down the RT and this brings up a series of bubbles. Each bubble is a higher level and you just equip which spell you want in each bubble. For example if you have a level 1 shock, level 2 blades, and level 3 wind you hold down the B button and let go when you get to the spell you want. This is really easy to use and I found this very useful. While combat is a large portion of the game socializing has always been a huge part of Fable and Fable II expands on this quite a bit. You can now get jobs and these range from blacksmithing to bartending. While these jobs are tedious they are almost required to earn a lot of gold to buy better items. These jobs are timing mini-games and can be pretty difficult to master. Each job has five different levels and you have to earn a certain amount of gold on that level before moving on. One important thing to note is you can never die! When you \"die\" you just lose all the experience that's lying around on the ground...this can either be great or bad for you depending on your playing style.\n",
       " \n",
       " Now Fable II has a whole marriage, child, sex thing and it's very useful if you want it. You have expressions you learn in the game by becoming more renowned in the world by completing tasks. certain expressions can be used to flirt, be rude, make people laugh etc. When you do these expressions you'll attract people and eventually someone might start liking you so much they'll offer gifts and even fall in love with you. When they do you offer them a wedding ring and set your home (more on buying property later) as the marital home and you're married. You have to go back sometimes and visit your spouse or they start hating you eventually will divorce you. You can have sex (yes it's blacked out you pervs!) either protected or unprotected and this can lead to child birth. Sometimes having unprotected sex with prostitutes can lead to STDs...and well you don't want to get those. Often you must come back and give your child a gift and use good expressions on them to keep them happy.\n",
       " \n",
       " Expressions are really a good way to also scare people during combat or to get your way in towns. You can also buy property and houses and even buy furniture and furnish them to your liking. If you don't want to move into one you can rent it out even. The same goes with stores and you just accumulate income as time goes on. If you want you can set a budget limit for your family to keep them happy so you can visit them less. This is great once you start buying a lot of property in the world. While the world is huge with lots of areas to visit they are all broken up with fairly long load times (even when the game is ripped to the HDD). There is a lot to do in the world of Albion such as solve Demon Door quests, hunt for treasure, finish jobs and side quests etc.\n",

Fable II is just such a charming game (the pub games are confusing though!) with a few minor flaws that can be overlooked though. Often does combat feel tedious after a while and the main story is still pretty short. While there is a lot more to do it's all repetitive quests and other things to do.

This is the ultimate remake of any classic sports game I've ever played. It's got new rosters, new graphics, new music, and best of all, it's NBA Jam! Forget what you know about real basketball, this is arcade basketball at its finest. No fouls, no timeouts, just crazy 2 on 2 fun. What's so great about this game is the endless unlockables. You can unlock tons of classic players from the past like Shaq on the Magic, Rodman, McHale, Jordan, Worthy, heck, you can even play as Ex Presidents as Republics VS the Democrats. The game supports 4 Wii controllers with or without the Nunchuck or the Classic controller. Old school gamers like me might want to consider the classic controller, while the Wii controller works fine, I felt more in control with the classic controller. If you don't want to use the motion controls, you can put the wii remote on it's side and play with just the d pad and the two buttons. So there's lots of control options for you.\n",

You can do the classic campaign or go into a Remix mode career that let's you play with power ups like power, quickness, speed, crazy crossovers and instant \"fire\". The computer sometimes seems to cheat to catch up when their down big, but that was in the old game, and it does always make for heated matchups. But the most fun you will have is playing with 3 other friends. 2 on 2 is the ultimate multiplayer experience. We played for 3 hours last night and didn't want to stop! With the huge amount of unlockables you can unlock, this game has a lot of replay value. Only it's lack of online play cuts it short from being nearly perfect. If you never played NBA Jam before, never fear, it's fun as long as you don't mind it's crazy dunks, and insane aspects. If you have played Jam before, this is the best Jam ever made and hopefully is only the beginning for the series on this gen of consoles. Boomshockalaka!\" - 403 Tokens,\n",

       " Sentence: \"There are many letdowns to the game, and it is not perfect. However, it provides an enjoyable gameplay experience, especially for fans of the movie, Black Hawk Down. There are many pros to the game, so let's start with them. For one thing, the levels are very well made, and almost compete with MOH Allied Assault. The most enticing missions take place in the Bakara Market or Mogadishu. Then there are the other missions where you can prance around for as long as you want, but that doesn't make it very fun. I'd say that this game has its biggest flaw in the time it takes to accomplish a level. In some places, you will finish a mission in 3-5 minutes, which, in my opinion, is a real bummer. What is even worse are the areas where the level is not very long at all, but it takes you an hour-and-a-half to get through it simply because there are swarms of unseen enemies. When you die a million times, it's hard to feel like a real Special Forces agent. If only there was a way to make the levels long and action-packed but not short and extremely frustrating! The other thing missing from a game like this and all of the Ghost Recon games is difficulty selection. There is just one damn hard difficulty in DFBHD and that is very annoying. It would be nice for a less-professional gamer to go through and be able to get shot 100 times before they die, just to get a feel for the level. After beating the game, unless they are mere sissies, then they can go back and play the game on a \"hard\" setting. the game lacks that feature. Possibly the last con are the times when action drags. When DFBHD gets to the action sequences they are very fun, but other times the game falls into a pit. Oh, and one last thing, the multiplayer is NOT top-notch. The games are nowhere near as fun as the Unreal Tournament scenarios, and to be worse, they are highly unstable. There are times when you can be in the middle of a multiplayer match when the game will just crash on top of you. For these reasons, I have stuck to multiplayer games such as Unreal Tournament. Overall, if you are looking for some nice, single-player gamelay then you should check out Black Hawk Down, the best game in the DF series by far! If you are looking for sheer multiplayer options, then there are many other games for a gamer like you. My Rating-8.2.\" - 433 Tokens,\n",

I have not only Ninja Gaiden and Ninja Gaiden 2 but Ninja Gaiden Black along with Sigma 1 and Sigma 2. I'm also someone who is a huge enthusiast for this gaming subgenrea. I have Devil May Cry 1-4, Bayonetta, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, God of War 1-3, Ninja Blade, Dante's Inferno and a host of others. I've experience some of the best all the way to the mediocre. I'm not a guru by any means but still an enthusiast. The thing is Itagaki and the REAL Team Ninja aren't there anymore. He and all the leads left because of that fiasco at Tecmo. Love Itagaki or hate him, he really knows how to make these games awesome. But I'm not here to discuss my opinion on difference on the development teams.\n",
       " \n",
       " I must say that I'm very disappointed with this entry in the series. I've always regarded the original Ninja Gaiden and Ninja Gaiden 2 as the gold standard for this type of game. I'm just quickly getting out the minor details out of the way. While technically, I'm not super impressed, it's not the reason why I'm really disgusted with this entry. The graphics and sounds are fine. Not amazing, but not really too bad to the point that it's hard to look at. Another part of the presentation is the story which doesn't really impress me either, but old or new Team Ninja, story was never their strong point. It was there to give the game structure but not be a majory selling point.\n",
       " \n",
       " My primary gripe honestly resolved around the changes in the gameplay, which is what made the first 2 entries in the series great. People always complained about the camera, but it was a minor problem at the most. What gets me though is the horrible level design. The previous games have large areas where there are some things to wall run along and do other stunts while also having plenty of room to deal out death. This new game it seems to like to put the player in a small to medium sized pen where guys come from behind obstacles like crashed cars until it feels you're ready to move on. There's no flow of combat with the area. No long hallways or large ballrooms or temple courtyards to flip or wall-run through. It's just a one level small pen. Which not much room to maneuver to be able to do your moves.\n",
       " \n",
       " The gameplay also feel sluggish and unresponsive. I found too many times that I was trying to turn Ryu or get him to flip out of a group of enemies or use specific combinations but it seems to not respond properly. There were times that I wanted him to fight a specific target and he wanted to look at someone else which would lead me to actually get hit. Even when I could gaet him to do what I want, it was slow and just didn't seem responsive. But that doeasn't matter because honestly this game is super easy even when it's not the \"hero\" mode the new developers talked about so much. In the previous games, if you button mashed, you learned that hardway and died. This game, you just get a gentle smack. There's no reward or satisfaction to doing something difficult because it's handed to you. The flow of combat seems off too. In the 1st Ninja Gaiden. It was focused on a target with a small of other other guys to go after. You almost had this nice way of focusing on a target yet can untangle then group or go after his friend. Ninja Gaiden 2 really improved it too where there was a fluid motion of engaging an enemy and finishing him then moving onto the next enemy withing a large group of enemies. It felt almost as though you could chain the fight into one large string of combos if you timed it well enough. Here it seems messy. Fights are somewhat chaotic but not in a good way. It was as though the 3rd game took both battle elements of the previous two games but made a mess of it. Nothing seemed to work right. Along with the sluggish controls, engagements just don't seem to have good pacing to do combos or to switch targets. The handling and gameplay elements just seem off to me. compared to other games in thie genre and even in this series.\n",
       " \n",
       " Now, Quick Time Events or QTE. I always hated these in God of War. I feel that they are a lazy way for developers to do over the top sequences without really making it part of the gameplay. I do find them done some ways where it's tasteful but for action games, I feel they are more detracting that fun. Games like Bayonetta and the new Castlevania overall kept these to a minimum which is what I like. I just don't find it fun doing a DDR rhythm game when I should be setting up combos to own a group of enemies. They're more there to distract the casual ADD gamer more than anything I think.\n",
       " \n",
       " A couple of other things I want to go through would be the lame gameplay gimmicks like the kunai climbing which is not only boring but doesn't seem to really have been done well at all. But maybe they wanted to distract us from the monotony. Another is the lack of decapitations. Personally, it's not just gore for gore's sake but more along the lines of gore that looks awesome because of the very nature of what ninja combat is. It's an great viseral aestetic of the nature of the game.\n",

If a game cannot work with the original console hardware (ie: An Xbox 360 with no hard drive and no internet access) then it is incredibly misleading and just a ploy to get people to buy the game. They should have made this crystal clear up front that this game needed a hard drive and Xbox gold membership.\n",

       " Sentence: \"There is one thing I should get straight before I start. I am not, nor have I ever been a fan of Britney Spears. I probably never will be. But I do like rhythm/dancing games, so I gave this one a try just for fun.\n",
       " The gameplay for the most part is basic. You try to press the correct buttons with the correct timing. Mostly you are using the x, circle, square and triangle buttons, but occasionally a directional button will be thrown in, which adds to the challenge immensely. You are auditioning to be one of Britney's backup dancers by dancing off against other dancers. You go through ten auditions before being allowed to audition against Britney herself. After each audition, you are awarded points based on your performance. These points eventually reward you with \"backstage passes\" that allow you to see video clips of Britney.\n",
       " The one innovative gameplay element that I like about this game is that when your competitor does well, he or she can make your moves harder. Every time your opponent strings a combo of ten button presses together, it adds or changes your sequence. It may change one of your buttons, it may add a directional button, it may cause one of your button presses to be moved up or back, or it may add one or two extra button presses so that you have to hit ten buttons in rapid succession. Of course, by stringing together a combo of ten yourself, you do the same thing to your opponent. Although this can be infuriating at times, it at least adds some challange to an otherwise simple game.\n",
       " I do have a few complaints about the game. First, it is too short and easy. You could play through the game with one dancer in a few hours easily, and through the entire game with all six dancers in a weekend. Therefore, I would just recommend this as a rental. Also, there are only five songs, and if you were not sick of hearing \"Oops...I did it again\" before, you will be after playing this game. My second complaint is that there should be a replay option. One problem with rhythm games is that while you are playing, you really cannot afford to look at what is going on because you have to be paying close attention to the meter. There should be a way to replay what you just did so you can watch all the moves that your dancer just did.\n",
       " If you like rhythm games, try this as a rental. You just might find the gameplay very addictive. If you like rhythm games and you are also a fan of Britney's, you might just find this worth you money. But for serious gamers, Dance Beat really does not offer much depth.\" - 466 Tokens,\n",

I truly think this game succeeds, even though it could have been much better. Sadly the worst part of this game is the story, which is disappointing for an RPG. The game excels during all of the addictive side missions, but any time they try to inject the story it greatly detracts from the experience. I played as a warrior, generally staying away from the bow and sorcery, as I thought neither of them worked too well. For the warrior, it's nice that each different type of weapon has a different attack series, but I wish there were more modifiers, and more ways to evolve improve those special attacks. I actually really like their weapon upgrading system, but it just needed a few tweaks. Every weapon or piece of armor is made up of a combination of steel, iron, chainmail, wood, cloth, and leather. You can upgrade everything with a certain amount of these raw materials very highly as long as you have upgraded you stats. The best part of this is that every weapon you get from a downed enemy can be dismantled to its raw parts. This means that even when you fight weak enemies way below your level you are greatly rewarded with the same amount of parts received from high level items. However, this also creates the biggest problem, where you've upgraded your favorite weapon to it's max, but when you get a new better weapon, your former favorite is now useless. All you can do is dismantle it for the same minimal amount as the lowest level of equipment, or you can sell it for a couple hundred gold, which is also useless.\n",
       " \n",
       " Like I said earlier, while the game itself is really fun and addictive, the story is horrendous (you're about to enter spoiler town). I can tell you the story in a few sentences: The story apparently starts right where the last left of (which is very annoying since I and probably everyone else couldn't play through the last horrible game) and your lifeforce is drained into your sister so the evil emperor can raise some evil god/demon. After being taken back to the dungeon a group of Orcs liberate you and then send you on a mission to essentially level up and learn how to kill the emperor. This is really the last of the story until later on where you start to learn about the annoying backstory of the emperor in an attempt to humanize him. Then once you finally get to confront the emperor it turns out he's a good guy trying to prevent the evil god form returning, while the woman you've been working for the whole game is actually the enemy. She then appears and turns into a dragon for your final battle. This is even worse because the only way to kill the dragon is to use these crossbows set up in a circle, a completely different mechanic that kind of works, and completely eliminates any benefits from leveling up the entire game.\n",

       " The game area is big, but awkwardly broken up. You play in regions - segments of land that seem completely disjointed from each other. The regions don't feel the same at all, and it's hard to remember how to get from one region to another because there's no visual connection, no guidance, etc. I often just end up using the \"fast travel\" feature because I've lost interest in trying to figure it out. In addition, the map is completely useless. I mean COMPLETELY useless. You see yourself represented as an arrow. But the arrow might mean which way your hero is facing, or which way the camera is looking? Haven't figured that out yet! There's dots to indicate quests, and a few other icons, but NOTHING to indicate where stores are, nothing to indicate which road might lead to which region - nothing.

       " You quickly end up with a lot of \"junk\" in your inventory. It doesn't help that for some reason, you HAVE to take or use any item you find.

I'm just going to give you all the basics on my review, because I don't feel like giving a thesis style review any longer. The game created on the premise of playing with All-Pro football players, along with either computer generated players, or your own creations. That being said, there are simply too few \"legends\" and many of them had modest NFL careers. With so many retired or dead former NFL players, why is Brian Bosworth and others like him in the game? So the former great roster isn't that deep, but the names of Rice, Marino, Star, Unitus, Sanders, and Earl Campbell are nice to play with. There are many former greats, but too many not so greats take up too much on the legends of the game rosters. Lets get to the meat: graphics and gameplay.\n",
       " Graphics are nothing more than my Xbox version in HD. There is a little more detail, but it is nothing like Madden 07. Not even close and this is very disappointing that I'm just playing a 2k5 type game on the 360. Don't get me wrong, everything looks nice but its not next gen at all. Same old 2k5 engine, same voice over and its very very disappointing from the eye candy standpoint.\n",
       " Gameplay: This game seems so much slow than Madden 07 even on all-pro settings. You have the typical formations from 2k5 with similar controls for both passing and running. Nothing really new here, except certain legends has the skill to steal a signal, so you can blitz or change the play accordingly. Then there is kicking interface to deal with. This is just plain horrible 2K! Maybe kicking and punting is too easy on Madden and on 2K5, but this Mike Tyson....LUDICROUS!!! There is no direction bar or power up bar...its all about timing. YOu simply hold the right stick back and then push it forward to kick as you approach the ball. Easy enough you say? I'll make a 41 yard field goal, but then miss several 25 yard ones. You'll literally kick the ball all over the place, unless you get your timing down. Then your right stick better be centered and not slightly off because it will effect the kick...so frustrating.\n",

I have created 3 teams, and one of them is loaded with Harry Potter created players, another one from my HS football teammates, and the last one is my family members.

       " First of all, the PS2 card has an 8MB capacity. It reportedly transfers data 200 times faster than the original PS memory card. Well, I haven't actually used a stopwatch, but it's true that the PS2 card saves and loads much faster.\n",
       " Does the PS2 card work for PS1 games? Absolutely not. I've tried this with several PS1 games, testing them in both my PS1 console and PS2 console. Not a single PS1 game was able to tell that a memory card was even inserted in the slot. So, please disregard anyone who tells you otherwise.\n",
       " Does the PS1 card work for PS2 games? Again, a big fat NO. Think about it. Forget about weather or not PS2 games is able to to use the card. The important issue is the size of the files versus the size of the card. Most of the files on my PS2 card range from 300 to 600k, which is 3-6 times the capacity of the card. Just forget about it.\n",

What I say is just from my experience, heavily biased toward the positive side since I have been a fan of the Battlefield series since the demo came out in 2002 for the Battlefield 1942 Wake Island map. This game, while carrying over some of the innovative features from its immediate predecessor, Battlefield 2, is yet more innovative, introducing the exciting new Titan Mode. In Titan Mode, players fight for control of missle silos which, once captured, begin a count-down toward firing a missle at the enemy titan's shield, eventually disabling it. Once the shield is down, the Titan can be borded, and the gameplay really gets intense. On the Titan, squads must coordinate attacks to disable four control pads for the main reactor room, and then the reactor itself. Points are awarded for doing much of the same things as in Battlefield 2, such as kills and healing your teammates, but also for disabling the said objectives in the titan. One advances through ranks as before, albeit more rapidly and with many more ranks to advance through. More weapons are available for unlock, although the kits are consolidated into four: Medic, Sniper, Support, and Anti-Tank/Engineer. Consolidation, thankfully, means versatility rather than just simplified gameplay, increasing the fun factor. This is an all around fun game to play; however, the real fun is online, since the computers, although effective target (and knife duel) practice, lack creativity of humans. Also, you cannot gain or use unlocks on single player. Use single player for practice, and then jump into multiplayer, and you are sure to have fun.\" - 292 Tokens,\n",

If you think about it, the games graphics were amazing considering the time it was introduced. I am still amazed today with the battle effects and cut scenes. Simply exceptional. The gameplay, well, to say in short, is wonderful. The game does an excellent job drawing the player into the storyline, and making the player FEEL like he or she is part of the game. I must have replayed this game over 30 times, each time finding new things. The FMV sequences are amazing, and cannot be beaten. There are too many people that state the game has bad graphics; the final fantasy series in itself has always had a cartoonish side to things, so i do not understand why anyone would say the graphics are bad. Sure we all have our playstation 2's and saw how amazing Final Fantasy X looked, but keep in mind the time Final Fantasy 7 was brought out. Also, the music is amazing. When Aeris died, the situation and music almost made me cry. Then the battle afterwards, had you so mad, that you felt like pummeling Genova with everything you had. Which is what most did.\n",

I prefer the DA to the 402, but I didn't give the DA 5 stars because the grip is not were it should be. Its a bit slippery compared to the 402.

Each level is between about 30 seconds and one minute, and the SLIGHTEST error throws you back to a loading screen, which you stare at for about 20 seconds. There's no detailed explanation of what you're supposed to do in a level until you're there, so expect to spend several minutes just figuring out what's expected of you. And once you know what you're doing, expect to do it over and over and over again. There are no check points, there is no way to save during a level, there is no way to lower the difficulty of the game: you just have to do the same thing repeatedly until you get it.\n",

And no, I'm not talking about the Final Fantasy Anthology or this \"Final Fantasy V Advance\" port. By the time these titles hit North America in 1998 and 2006, 2D RPGs were already retro. No matter how much one might enjoy retrospection, you simply can't play a video game two to three console generations after its release and not expect the impact to be diminished. All I'm saying is Square did its North American fanbase and its product a great disservice by not giving it an English SNES release back in '92.\n",

       " Final Fantasy V is a somewhat enigmatic title to series outsiders. Casual fans who played the English translations of Final Fantasy \"2\" and \"III\" back on the SNES and then lost track of the series might not even know it exists. Among the more hardcore series fans that have played it-- whether they were patient enough to wait for this or another port or were sufficiently emulation-savvy to play the RPGe fan translation beforehand-- the reactions are remarkably polarized. As the other reviews on this site will attest, people seem to either adore Final Fantasy V, or abhor it.\n",
       " \n",
       " I've personally spoken to more than one person that was under the mistaken impression that Final Fantasy V is just a 16-bit remake of Final Fantasy III. This isn't the case at all. Here's the story in a nutshell:\n",
       " \n",
       " ~Spoiler~\n",
       " Four people are chosen by the four elemental Crystals to defend the world against evil. The first crystal tells them to go find the other three immediately before transforming them into super-powered warriors. So off they go, into a world of pirates, sea monsters, and dragons. They meet an old man named Cid, fly around in an airship, and explore the ruins of an advanced lost civilization. They wind up on a second world map and go on even more adventures. As the evil wizard antagonist's scheme to unleash a dark primordial force nears fruition, the heroes find a submarine and uncover a set of ancient forbidden weapons and spells to help them even the odds with the villain. Then they get sucked into an alternate dimension and the four warriors who saved the world during a previous crisis appear to help the heroes defeat an avatar of the Void, and then...\n",
       " \n",
       " ...I... honestly can't remember whether I was trying to sum up Final Fantasy III or Final Fantasy V's plot just now.\n",
       " ~End Spoiler~\n",
       " \n",
       " Admittedly, yes, Final Fantasy V's plot is derivative and silly, even for a JRPG. In the first TEN MINUTES of the game, the king rides off on a dragon, the princess gets knocked cold by a meteor crash, and a passing adventurer riding a giant yellow ostrich saves her from getting dragged away by goblins. The princess and the adventurer then happen upon an amnesiac old man lying around nearby, and then all three narrowly escape an earthquake and get captured by pirates. The leader of the pirates plans on holding them for ransom, but changes her mind when she discovers something odd about the princess's pendant. Unless DMT is involved, no ten minutes are EVER this eventful. Whereas Final Fantasy IV's implausible scenario is redeemed by the diverse and colorful cast to which it takes a backseat, Final Fantasy V is full of Sunday morning cartoon characters who get tossed around by an even more ridiculous plot. This seems to be the main reason a lot of fans aren't too fond of the fifth installment.\n",
       " \n",
       " However, the real charm of this game lies in two key words: Job System. Final Fantasy V is not a game you play for its plot. While the previous game was designed with a focus on trying to tell a dramatic story, V was about taking the standard-issue JRPG battle system into third gear. The ATB system is back, and now comes with a time gauge that takes the guesswork out of the game. The Job System is back, expanded and vastly improved. Not only are there more character classes, fewer duplicates, and (somewhat) more balance between them, but now party members can switch Jobs at no JP/AP cost, learn new abilities by increasing Job levels, and best of all, mix and match skills between classes. Final Fantasy IV experimented with trickier boss fights; Final Fantasy V has twice as many boss battles as IV, and pretty much ALL of them have some sort of trick to overcoming them. In light of such great battle and character progression systems, a lack of a serious, sensical story isn't all that much of a setback.\n",
       " \n",
       " In defense of the plot, V is the first Final Fantasy installment with a consistent sense of humor. Each character has a goofy \"surprise\" sprite and a two-frame \"laughing\" animation. The other characters make fun of Bartz for being afraid of heights, which is the result of a traumatic childhood hide-and-seek incident. Before Faris reveals herself as a woman Bartz and Galuf are flabbergasted about why they find the handsome young pirate captain so inexplicably appealing. The fourth wall is broken at least once. Then there's Gilgamesh-- everything he says and does is ridiculous, and he's the game's second most recurring antagonist. If Final Fantasy V's plot has a single redeeming factor, it's how rarely it takes itself seriously.\n",
       " \n",
       " As was previously mentioned, Final Fantasy V's improved version of the Job System introduced in III is this game's most prominent and best feature, but it should also be said that it has the potential to absolutely bork the game once you start exploiting it. Final Fantasy V isn't precisely a walk in the park-- not like VI or VIII-- but the difficulty is noticeably lower than it was in III and IV, a pair a games that DIDN'T let you augment your dual-wielding ninja with Rapidfire and Spellblade abilities, or give your magic user Doublecast and have him fire off Bahamut, Quick, Meteor, Bahamut, Meteor, Bahamut, Quick, and keep endlessly hurling spells until he runs out of MP. Final Fantasy V is the first really unbalanced game in the series, though abusing the system requires a lot of time, effort, and homework.\n",
       " \n",
       " Aside from its long being known as the \"lost\" Final Fantasy in the NA and PAL territories and the Job System shenanigans, Final Fantasy V's most important claim to fame is that it was the final installment directed by series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. He still retains producer credits on later installments, but from what I understand that is a far less direct role in the development process. As far as I am concerned, this makes it the last of the old school Final Fantasy games. I'm not going to waste time here weighing in on the whole video games: art? issue here, but it's undeniable that the medium possesses narrative capabilities that never occurred to the creators and players of Pac-Man, Missile Command, and Q*bert. But Sakaguchi saw this potential. He has been directly quoted as stating that his reason for wanting to try his hand at RPG design was because he thought he'd be good at telling a story.\n",
       " \n",
       " Final Fantasy told a story. Each successive sequel told more of a story, and this has become a sturdy pillar of the series' success.\n",
       " \n",
       " In the end, Final Fantasy V is a hard game to approach. Unlike the previous four titles, it breaks very little new ground. Enumerating its lasting influences, quirks, and innovations would be a short read, unless it became a dissertation of the Job System and battle mechanics. But this in itself illustrates why Final Fantasy V represents such a significant stage in the evolution of the series. Final Fantasy V isn't designed to blow apart the foundations of the genre, blur the lines between cinema and gaming, convey (explicit) social commentary, serve as a 200-hour time sink for compulsive completionists, or act as a multimillion dollar CGI tech demo. Neither, for that matter, were any of its predecessors, but they all had novelty on their side-- the kind of novelty that a fourth sequel would be hard-pressed to match. Final Fantasy V is where it became clear that SquareSoft would have to think bigger in order to keep up the series' momentum. It is also the very last Final Fantasy installment that is totally content with JUST being a game.\n",

Turtle Beach must be using one of the better plants because this device is very solid; they did not use cheap or light plastic. I weighed it in at 327 grams, which is approximately the weight of one and a half PS4 controllers. Along with the weight, the rubber feet on the bottom prevent the device from sliding, even on a glass table. This is important when pressing against the levers; the unit doesnt move around when adjusting on the fly. Even the analog volume feels solid and well built; no slop in the controls whatsoever.\n",

You need the traditional aux and mic connectors.\n",
       " \n",
       " Speaking of testing with the Wings of Angel, I was amazed at the quality increase I experienced by using the tactical audio controller. While I was impressed with the sound quality from the Wings of Angel before, I am now blown away. The bass is richer and the high notes are crisper, plus the controller successfully turned them into a 7.1 surround headset. A quick software test proved it was able to throw sounds in just the right places. If you are a little reluctant to fork out $200 for the tactical audio controller AND another $200 for the Elite Headset, don't worry. Put your money into the controller and you will be surprised at how well a budget pair of headphones goes along with it.\n",
       " \n",
       " While I am a PS4 gamer, I mainly use the tactical audio controller on my Windows 10 PC. Im mostly a Steam gamer with the occasional Blizzard game (notably SC2). Hooking this up to the PC was really simple; just attach the USB power cable to the device and PC and you are connected. From there you follow setting up the device in your Windows playback devices panel. Oddly enough, there is no software to install from Turtle Beach; it uses Windows drivers and controls. This might worry some people as it seems less than advanced, but really, it works more slick than I had expected. The advanced control isn't in the software so much as it is in the device itself.\n",
       " \n",
       " Also, because the audio controller holds all the components needed, you don't have to worry about the quality of your sound card. This is even more important when using a laptop as the built-in cards tend to be limited.\n",

There are good video sequences within the game, however the ending is abrupt, and after I beat what was the last level, I was shocked that that was the end of the game, honestly believing that I had more game play ahead of me.

The exposition is solid and the level progression is good as is the story telling.\n",
       " \n",
       " There is a difference. While stealth is important to this game it's no longer fully essential. The focus on this game is light vs. dark, cover, and action oriented stealth. Enemies don't have flashlights, or if they do they don't fully penetrate the dark any more and Sam can back off from a fire fight and kill enemies from different angles. What this means is Sam is more of an action hero than before. There's a number of very sweet tricks that Sam can do if he's using stealth take downs. The big one is Mark & Execute where he targets up to 4 targets and can kill each of them from cover in an instant, almost guaranteeing stealth for the kills.\n",
       " \n",
       " In addition Gunplay occurs more often but Sam is able to take cover and sneak off of the fire fights. And while there's a hive mentality (all enemies know what a single enemy knows, so if one guy sees Sam and then instantly dies, all enemies know where Sam is) the action for the game works better in that respect. Once you have four guys shooting at your cover and figure out how to slip away to flank them again, you'll appreciate the focus on gunplay more.\n",

For those of you who were disappointed with the original release, the expansion, \"Reaper of Souls\" gives us a new class and Blizzard also rolled out a \"Loot 2.0\" system as part of the update (it was a free update, expansion wasn't required). Finally you have a multitude of worthwhile items to collect and use. This simple change completely turned the game around (along with other patch improvements). With the Ultimate Evil Edition, we have the expansion plus the base game, meaning 6 classes, 5 Acts, and several new modes (including a feature exclusive to consoles currently).\n",
       " \n",
       " Controls: For PS4, the game fully utilizes all buttons on the gamepad. As you level up, you'll unlock new skills which will be assigned to the different buttons (until all are being utilized). So much, in fact, that at times I've forgotten to use some of my skills in chaotic battles. The left stick moves you and the right stick has you doing a slow dodge. I've personally not found much use of dodge, as enemies seem to hit me anyway, but I just have them roll around for fun or to break breakables. The menu takes a little getting used to, as it's on a radial-dial where you scroll through your various equipment locations (e.g. head, body, hands, rings). Once you get used to it, it doesn't really take too much time, but if you're playing with others you may have to wait for them to finish. You can also mark items as \"junk\" to sell with a click of a button. I found myself not using this feature, though it is there. When an item drops and you pick it up, you also have the ability to quickly equip or mark as junk. Once picked up, 3 categories with green up arrows (meaning better stats) or red down arrows (for lesser stats) will show on the screen. I never use this feature, as there are a lot of nuances with gear and I'd prefer to look at them one by one.\n",
       " \n",
       " Gameplay: The basic premise of the game, for those unfamiliar, is run through each location killing all enemies you see using a variety of powers. Said enemies drop items, collectively known as \"loot\", upon dying which make your character stronger. This is the addictive cycle of the Diablo games - collect loot, level up, get new skills, kill more enemies with different skills, repeat.\n",
       " \n",
       " The maps are well put together, but unlike the previous entry, the maps have randomized elements, but aren't truly randomized. That is probably one of the biggest flaws in my opinion, as the changing maps gave the previous Diablo infinite replayability and that feeling of discovery. Once I visited an area, I knew exactly where the important stuff (and boundaries) would be any time I went through again.\n",
       " \n",
       " You have several classes to choose from: the hardy and furious Barbarian, the stoic and martial Monk, the dark, ranged Demon Hunter, the primitive and controlling Shaman, and the studious and magical Wizard from the base game, plus the stalwart and strong Crusader from the expansion (and my personal favorite). Every class has a male and female variant. You have access to unique skills and \"rune\" slots, which unlock at specific levels and customize each base skill. For instance, the Wizard has a beam attack that can be changed into split beams with a rune, or to have a shorter but wider beam for close attacks. It allows for flexibility and different builds, but you can't switch it on the fly. Unlike previous games, you can't create a Warrior Wizard who wades into combat swinging a sword, the Barbarian can't used ranged weapons, and the Demon Hunter is restricted to ranged only, considering all their skills required a ranged weapon. This is one of the biggest flaws of the game, in my opinion, coming from Diablo 2. I wanted to use the Demon Hunter as a shadow stalker, dual wielding knives or swords. Sadly, you do not have a choice in this and have to play each class as Blizzard wants.\n",

       " \n",
       " One of the great advantages of the console version is couch co-op play! If you don't have a friend to join, you can find matches to join online as well.

Enemies heads can explode or be removed from their body (watching it fly through the air), zombies whose upper and lower half separate, only to have their upper half crawl towards you, and many other great animations and effects are present. The game is zoomed out enough that the minor details that would look really low resolution up close appear fine. The cutscenes are all top notch and beautiful, and each chapter introduction starts with story book like drawing/animation.\n",

       " Story: A star has fallen and you go to investigate. From there, you'll meet faces familiar and new and uncover the secret of a growing terror. For what the game is, the story is good, but nothing new. Depending on how close you pay attention, you can probably see each plot twist or reveal coming.

       " --------------------\n",
       " Overall: 4/5 - With the Loot 2.0 system, it's fun to go out and slay monsters and power up your character. The gameplay is solid and addictive, but not incorporating randomly generated maps and not allowing for full customization for characters is a step back. This is technically the expansion with the base game included for free, but it's a great arcade-like action/RPG that will satiate a need to hunt for loot and slay powerful enemies - especially with friends (online or off).\n",
       " --------------------\n",
       " Gameplay: Lots of skills to unlock, plenty of enemies to defeat, and more loot than you hold creates an exciting and addictive experience.

       " Other then the graphics though, RE5 left me a bit dissapointed. For me, this whole game acted more like an expansion pack of RE4, with nothing there to truly distance itself from the other game to make it a stand alone. Also, as far as scare facor goes, I give this game about a four out of ten, the game relying mostly on cheap, jump out of nowhere scares.\n",
       " \n",
       " Next is Sheva, who I am very split on. For those playing co-op, she can be a valuable assist, having someone watch your back in case combat gets too hectic. While I think this takes away a bit from the tension factor, it's still a nice addition. Now when you get to solo play, things get frusturating. While she is good to have for added fire power and carrying around items, she can be a bit of a nuesance. Though she comes with two commands that will have her be less or more aggresive, either way, she still burns through a lot of ammo and by the time the chapter is over, you find yourself trying to compenaste for her gun happy ways. Overall, Sheva is more suited for co-op game play.\n",

Okay, cool, I can deal with that. What I can't deal is the added cruch of trying to exchange stuff with my partner by having to bring up the inventory slot, selecting an item and then exchanging for stuff, which wastes valuable time if your in the middle of a hectic battle.

The main feature I don't like is the \"WASD\" console style controls, I much prefer the \"point and click\" interface. Rather than comparing it to \"Diablo\" or \"Diablo II LOD\" i find myself comparing it to \"Guild Wars\", \"Oblivion\" and \"KOTR\". I've had some crashes and glitchies, crash to desktop and freeze-ups but by installing the game's version of DirectX it seems to be working much better but NOT perfect. It is a lot of fun to play when you're in the sewers for example you DO have a sense of being in a sewer. A lot of the destructible objects remind me of the Agea Phys-X effects we saw in \"Silverfall\", fuel cylinders explode, wooden skids shatter into toothpicks etc. The maps and areas so far encountered are small so you can sit and play for an hour or two completing a quest, you're not stuck for hours on end trying to find a waypoint in an endless area. The Quest tracking system works nicely, you don't have to fumble around trying to figure out what region you're supposed to go to or what you're supposed to do to complete the quest, it tells you: \"Stricken Gardens, kill 16 beasties\" then when you've done that it tells you: 'Go to Loreli Approach, speak to DumDum\" to collect your reward. Note, I changed the quest info for that example so this is NOT a spoiler. I dunno that this game is worth the $[...] i paid for it but at $[...] I think it's a good value. Unfortunately it's still NOT what I'd like \"Diablo III\" to look and feel like. But it's fun to play.\" - 308 Tokens,\n",

So I guess the only true downside of FO4 is not enough hours in the day. Well worth the investment.\" - 70 Tokens,\n",

       " Sentence: \"When you look at the price comparison between a regular Blu-Ray player and a Playstation 3, the decision of what to buy is a no brainer. With the PS3 you not only get an extraordinary Blu-Ray player, but so much more. In terms of the player, PS3 beats other options hands down in terms of loading time, which is one of the main points of criticism for regular Blu-Ray players.

       " This new gaming system has graphics and gameplay that are out of this world. You only need to grab a game like \"Heavenly Sword\" to feel like the expenditure was worthwhile. The use of Bluetooth technology for the wireless controller is a big improvement over previous versions. The system reacts flawlessly and in time to the commands from the controller. And then there is the motion controller feature, which allows combining the normal type controls with a Wii type experience. Games such as Rub a Duck, which you can get from the online store, are played exclusively by using the motion control.\n",

The game could have been better though if it allowed for multiplayer racing in the same system (i.e. splitting the screen in 2) and had a wider selection of tracks. Those that are interested in backwards integration, rest assured that the PS2 games work great on this new system. I have played several and have not had a single issue so far.\n",
       " \n",
       " The other feature that I love about the PS3 is the wireless capability and the ability to share files from your PC. Setting up the wireless was an easy process that took less than two minutes. Even though browsing the web with the PS3 is not the easiest, it gets better if you use a keyboard and mouse (either Bluetooth or USB). Sharing your music, pictures and video from your computer is straightforward, but you will have to seek instructions on how to do it. The basic process involves going to your PC and in Windows Media Player (there are other options available in terms of software used for sharing, but most people will probably use this) you need to enable sharing and select the PS3 as one of the approved devices. Then you can use the PS3 to create slideshows with your music, for a truly relaxing experience.\n",
