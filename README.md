# Amazon_Customer_Data
NLP and Recommendation Systems

This repo is in progress and contains the data science project analyzing text data from reviews to predict ratings and purchasing data to create a recommendation. 

The data used in this analysis is very large, and is not uploaded to this repo. It can be downloaded from https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html. 

IPython Notebook Files located in this repo:<br>
1_Video_Games_Wrangling.ipynb   -   current working file for wrangling and cleaning the Amazon video games data.<br>
zz__1_ACD_Data_Wrangling.ipynb  -  initial wrangling project working with books data. This proved too large a dataset for my laptop alone.<br>
zz__1_Books_21Mil_Wrangling.ipynb  -  second attempt to work with a smaller version of the books data. This was still too large.
